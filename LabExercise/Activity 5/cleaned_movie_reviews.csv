"mr. & mrs. smith","people are misunderstanding this series","gehete","this series has nothing but the premise in common with s mr and mrs smith first of all the main lead while charming in his own right is no brad pitt similarly the female lead no angelina jolie the premise of the first movie was shallow it was just  overly attractive film stars who were never seen together in a movie fawning over each other and displaying their sexiness with some bad plot in the background this movie actually explores the plot two pretend married agents going on missions and step by step getting intimate it is a blurry line they are traversing between the professional strictly lethal business and the attraction it is complexa very messy unconventional hands on movie i would very much like to compare to beef you never know where the plot is going or how the relationship will develop its messiness does contribute to it losing focus it is set up as a spy thriller but the dialogue is very much atlanta like way more casual intertwined than any spy movie ive ever watched this is however to its detriment sometimes because whilst the story the progression are enjoyable due to the complexity it creates you have a hard time buying either of the characters as stone cold killers they are supposed to bestill the dialogue is simply superb the chemistry is there the story is a thrill you just need to remove the bradjelina glasses and enjoy the ride",2024-02-07,NA

"mr. & mrs. smith","disappointing boring flat","laight","theres so much wrong with this show its hard to know where to begin the worst part might be that the two leads are actually excellent actors but you wouldnt know it if you judged them solely on this show because they are forced to play possibly the two dullest human beings who have ever existed the entire first episode with a small exception for one moment of inane drama is like watching paint dry but without the excitement its almost as if the two are having a boring contest who can be the dullest person they both win and they continue to win throughout this extremely poorly written poorly plotted show how donald glover one of the most talented young actors got roped into this is the only mystery this show presents",2024-02-04,NA

"mr. & mrs. smith","somewhat interesting but ultimately falls flat","cbrueggemeyer","i fell victim to the marketing ploys of this show and was excited for this show to be released watching most of the series the day it was releasedit is well made and had a good production value well shot and for the most part well acted but i find the subject matter to be dull and the writing to be a bit lazythis is a spy show that is missing all of the quintessential spy things found in the genre first off the characters are basically craigslist kirklandbrand spies they are not very good at their jobs and they are following the orders of a chatgtp style entity also the series is episodic so they are in a new location doing a new task every episode this is okay but  of the episode is spent examining their relationship while  is spent doing a few spy thingsall of the realism in this show is spent on relationship building its like a committee sat down and wrote a standard rom com using fights quirks and highlights from all of their previous relationships and packages them into a show needing a hook they threw in a few lazilywritten spy scenes to match it watchableim being a bit harsh here the series is somewhat enjoyable and the relationship scenes are pretty well executed and well thought out but if you are looking for an espionagespy show with any sort of realism this isnt it this is a show about the fake marriage between two people that just happen to be spies",2024-02-06,NA

"how to have sex (2023)","ridiculous ending","chrisrowe","one of the main things i disliked about this film was the title not because of some misguided belief in the censoring of the word sex but because of the conversations that ensued many times after telling a friend about the astonishing film i had just seen at the cinemabesides that minor inconvenience the film showcased a phenomenal range of talent in all aspects of the film molly manning walker shows off her modern and evocative cinematography to truly connect the audience with the characters walker also wrote the script which is equally brilliant and manages to capture the essence of youth in each of the characters not only that but she also shows no hesitation in creating a realistic depiction of youth which is extremely difficult to find in films today walker has created a film which weaves the innocence of three young adults into a story of loneliness and despair that is strikingly relevant to the world todayit is obvious that this film is deeply personal to not only walker but also to the three actresses that played the main parts a story with such tangible emotion cannot be written without a deeply personal idea at the core the film will put you in the shoes of three young women and will tell you exactly how women feel todaythe performances of the three young adults was masterful it was like they werent even acting the slow decline of taras outward personality to a lonelier and more isolated one is showcased brilliantly by mia mckennabruce the comedy that flourished at the start of the film was perfected by the young womens ability to so accurately display the emotions that run through every persons head at that agedisturbing and hilarious this film left me in my seat a few minutes after it finished unlike any other film i have ever seen it will take you on a journey that youve already had before but always wanted to experience again the journey of youth and maybe youll realize you actually probably and in most circumstances do not want to experience that journey again",2023-08-14,NA

"saltburn (2023)","pretentious garbage","mjw","saltburn directed by emerald fennell who brought us the excellent a promising young woman is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the mazelike world of the english aristocracy but unfortunately it loses its way the film stars barry keoghan as oliver quick a scholarship student at oxford university and jacob elordi as felix catton a charming aristocrat who invites oliver to spend a summer at his familys sprawling estate saltburnsaltburn is set in the mids a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence it attempts to explore the clash of social classes moral vacuity and the seductions of wealth however the films historical and cultural context feels superficial failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time despite being promising the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety the film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness but it doesnt quite hit the mark forced and repetitive dialogues which frequently feel artificial and contrived further weaken the narrativedespite having talented actors portraying them the characters lack depth oliver played by keoghan is a hateful lustful and envious character but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated felix played by elordi is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege but his flimsy compassion does not seem realalthough fennells direction is bold it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life the films pacing is erratic certain scenes seem rushed while others drag on needlessly the movies soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story the movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringingthe cinematography and production design are perhaps the films strongest points the grandeur of saltburn the sprawling estate is captured beautifully and the film does a commendable job of creating a livedin feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time these artistic components however are insufficient to make up for the films weak narrativesaltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little despite its grand setting and talented cast it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters its a film that tries to be a critique of the english aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts while it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal its a film that unfortunately doesnt live up to its potential its not a film id recommend",2023-12-24,NA

"saltburn (2023)","vastly overrated obvious and focused on shock value","brentsbulletinboard","it is  and scholarship student oliver quick has just arrived at oxford he doesnt fit in with the upperclass atmosphere and has no acquaintances after befriending felix catton a popular and wealthy fellow student however oliver finally seems to find his place at the university invited to the catton family home saltburn for the summer holidays oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods nothing is as it seems though as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itselfwritten and directed by emerald fennell saltburn is an initially intriguing though ultimately irritatingly derivative predictable psychological comichorror fennells narrative begins with promise in the first act you arent sure who to trust nor where the story is heading however after the action moves to the manor house saltburn things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films be they the talented mr ripley teorema or the servantthose films examined themes such as class difference obsessiveness personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes never going into them with depth nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions one in particular acts in a violent vacuum of selfobsession and jealously but why what made this character the way they are fennel never bothers to tell us seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the darkmoreover her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches oliver is essentially just a less charismatic scouse tom ripley with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness felix is exactly like ripleys object of obsession dickie greenleaf while his eccentric family are people weve seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy the ruling class among them familiar and lacking in depth fennells characters arent particularly interesting nor is her narrative particularly original further while her dialogue is frequently funny it can also be pretentious particularly during olivers intermittent narrationthroughout the film fennell handles the material with great deference too much one might argue she lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power the ending featuring fullfrontal nudity reminiscent of the music video to liam gallaghers once starring a thankfully clothed eric cantona seems selfindulgent and shall we say cocky furthermore a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy so completely does it abandon realworld logicconversely linus sandgrens glossy cinematography is striking sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles heightening the suspense of the narrative as well as compounding the decadence of the catton family he employs a ratio of  giving the film a topheavy boxedin look making locations feel daunting it is work full of contrast although a cynical critic might suggest an overreliance on cliched visual metaphors such as reflections or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wingshowever sandgrens visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings as does suzie davies rich production design textured and detailed her work fosters a vivid immersive atmosphere which sophie canales costume design and charlotte dirickxs set decoration compounds in addition anthony williss score is stirring his original pieces are seedy and evocative while songs used throughout perhaps most notably sophie ellisbextors murder on the dancefloor complement the narrativebarry keoghan stars as oliver alongside jacob elordi as felix alison oliver as felixs sister venetia and rosamund pike as felixs mother elspeth keoghan is a fascinating actor who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence here however he gives an inconsistent performance when playing oliver as a weird insular personality he shines though when he has to display his dominant side keoghan lacks conviction and doesnt convince an oddly played oddly written nighttime scene with venetia being clearest evidence of thiselordi does much more assured work despite the fact that the character is just a  version of the aforementioned greenleaf he impresses though overcoming the scant characterisation of the role oliver is excellent underplaying the complexities of her character while pike steals the show as the eccentric elspeth richard e grant also stars as felixs father but is criminally underutilised while archie madekwes grating performance as felixs cousin is smug and onenotein conclusion emerald fennells saltburn is a film trying to provoke though isnt as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is though it is funny from time to time and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful the film is ultimately an uneven predictable and derivative affair while the cinematography is striking and the

"killers of the flower moon (2023)","not the magnificent masterpiece i was hoping for not by far","imseeg","killers of the flower moon is a western crime drama film cowritten and directed by martin scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to

scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth

"killers of the flower moon (2023)","not the magnificent masterpiece i was hoping for not by far","imseeg","killers of the flower moon is a western crime drama film cowritten and directed by martin scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another wellcrafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veterans library as mentioned previously it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period after all as the classic saying goes  those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat iti rate it a solid ",2023-10-19,NA

long runtimes epics like lawrence of arabia or das boot are both over three hours in length and rocket along at a brisk pace largely because of fastidious editing the duration of both those pictures is necessary one could argue to tell their stories without sacrificing details coherence or excitement then there are films like heavens gate which also has a runtime of over three hours and is a bloated selfindulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director michael ciminos arrogant refusal to cut anythingmartin scorseses killers of the flower moon teeters somewhere between both camps it has elements deserving of high praise but is inarguably too long with pacing structural and narrative issues galore based on the nonfiction novel of the same name by david grann the film centers on emmet burkhart a simpleminded world war i veteran who returns to the osage nation to the home of his uncle william king hale there emmet falls for an osage named mollie who his uncle tells him is set to inherit much of her peoples oil headrights meanwhile someone is killing off the wealthy osage in the area and it looks like mollies family might be nexton paper it sounds like a fascinating exciting picture with dashes of psychological intrigue however scorseses version of the tale is dour swollen and predictable granns riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed lacking any kind of suspense or momentum screenwriters scorsese and eric roth cram too much into the narrative namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa they have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly which they dont do preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play outhad scorsese and longtime collaborator thelma schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth things could have been different there are some brilliant sequences in the movie in fact the first third is engaging and intriguing the mystery is successfully set up the location established and the characters introduced then things start going downhill the pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime until the end of course when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion beyond pacing there are some fundamental flaws editingwise that are inexplicable considering scorsese and schoonmakers prestigefor example seemingly important characters are introduced then disappear for long stretches of time similarly the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times or overlooked leaving us in the dark furthermore at times cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak all this including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative is amateur work far below scorsese and schoonmakers levelthis is not to say however that killers of the flower moon is without redeeming elements to make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation no matter its effectiveness scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the osage people the film doesnt explore the historical or cultural context of the osage nation nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivorsscorsese and roths narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the osage or the systemic injustice that they face their characterisation lacks depth or nuance relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes had he focused on the perspective and agency of the osage rather than the corrupt inept white characters scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his handsconversely rodrigo prietos cinematography is evocative and enchanting it makes for a stunning watch proving scorseses eye for visuals has not been blinded under scorseses direction prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the oklahoma landscape astutely while jack fisks detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness which adam williss set decoration and jacqueline wests costume design only compoundsmoreover the late great robbie robertsons score is striking bearing a resemblance to the work of ry cooder full of sleazy slide guitars and indian

"killers of the flower moon (2023)","not the magnificent masterpiece i was hoping for not by far","imseeg","killers of the flower moon is a western crime drama film cowritten and directed by martin scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another wellcrafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veterans library as mentioned previously it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period after all as the classic saying goes  those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat iti rate it a solid ",2023-10-19,NA

long runtimes epics like lawrence of arabia or das boot are both over three hours in length and rocket along at a brisk pace largely because of fastidious editing the duration of both those pictures is necessary one could argue to tell their stories without sacrificing details coherence or excitement then there are films like heavens gate which also has a runtime of over three hours and is a bloated selfindulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director michael ciminos arrogant refusal to cut anythingmartin scorseses killers of the flower moon teeters somewhere between both camps it has elements deserving of high praise but is inarguably too long with pacing structural and narrative issues galore based on the nonfiction novel of the same name by david grann the film centers on emmet burkhart a simpleminded world war i veteran who returns to the osage nation to the home of his uncle william king hale there emmet falls for an osage named mollie who his uncle tells him is set to inherit much of her peoples oil headrights meanwhile someone is killing off the wealthy osage in the area and it looks like mollies family might be nexton paper it sounds like a fascinating exciting picture with dashes of psychological intrigue however scorseses version of the tale is dour swollen and predictable granns riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed lacking any kind of suspense or momentum screenwriters scorsese and eric roth cram too much into the narrative namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa they have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly which they dont do preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play outhad scorsese and longtime collaborator thelma schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth things could have been different there are some brilliant sequences in the movie in fact the first third is engaging and intriguing the mystery is successfully set up the location established and the characters introduced then things start going downhill the pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime until the end of course when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion beyond pacing there are some fundamental flaws editingwise that are inexplicable considering scorsese and schoonmakers prestigefor example seemingly important characters are introduced then disappear for long stretches of time similarly the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times or overlooked leaving us in the dark furthermore at times cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak all this including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative is amateur work far below scorsese and schoonmakers levelthis is not to say however that killers of the flower moon is without redeeming elements to make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation no matter its effectiveness scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the osage people the film doesnt explore the historical or cultural context of the osage nation nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivorsscorsese and roths narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the osage or the systemic injustice that they face their characterisation lacks depth or nuance relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes had he focused on the perspective and agency of the osage rather than the corrupt inept white characters scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his handsconversely rodrigo prietos cinematography is evocative and enchanting it makes for a stunning watch proving scorseses eye for visuals has not been blinded under scorseses direction prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the oklahoma landscape astutely while jack fisks detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness which adam williss set decoration and jacqueline wests costume design only compoundsmoreover the late great robbie robertsons score is striking bearing a resemblance to the work of ry cooder full of sleazy slide guitars and indian chants it complements the narrative perfectly the inclusion of periodaccurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism which in the times of baz luhrmann who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces is most welcome the last project robertson worked on before his death his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansongleonardo dicaprio stars as emmet alongside lily gladstone as mollie and robert deniro as king hale dicaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances but here takes a page out of the daniel day lewis playbook the most intense acting must surely be the best dicaprio spends the whole film frowning scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his characters expressions and eccentricities in the first third he has a bit of range though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performanceas does lily gladstone initially she creates in mollie a nuanced and witty character who can see through people she doesnt suffer fools and we find her both compelling and captivating however after the first third of the film she becomes subservient unquestioning and dull and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being shall we say slowed down deniro for his part plays king hale like an evil george burns manipulative darkly funny and morally bereft anytime hes on screen the film is a joy hes the best thing about itthey are supported by a large cast of talented actors some of whom do great work ty mitchell is excellent as john a poor man drawn into emmet and king hales plans who has more dignity then the both of them combined jesse plemons does typically fine work as fbi man tom white while louis cancelmi is seedily slick as kelsie morrison a stooge of king hales on the other hand the likes of cara jade myers as mollies alcoholic sister and brendan fraser in a thankfully small role as king hales lawyer are both so miscast and over the top they distract from everything going on around themits a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a dean martin song the money song from  them that have it get more of it the less they need it the more they love it such is the thesis of the film greed spreads like a plague and the richer you are the greedier you are its not original nor is it profound this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in  in mervyn leroys the fbi storyat the end of the day killers of the flower moon is a truncated adaptation of a great nonfiction book overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message despite

"killers of the flower moon (2023)","not the magnificent masterpiece i was hoping for not by far","imseeg","killers of the flower moon is a western crime drama film cowritten and directed by martin scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another wellcrafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veterans library as mentioned previously it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period after all as the classic saying goes  those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat iti rate it a solid ",2023-10-19,NA

long runtimes epics like lawrence of arabia or das boot are both over three hours in length and rocket along at a brisk pace largely because of fastidious editing the duration of both those pictures is necessary one could argue to tell their stories without sacrificing details coherence or excitement then there are films like heavens gate which also has a runtime of over three hours and is a bloated selfindulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director michael ciminos arrogant refusal to cut anythingmartin scorseses killers of the flower moon teeters somewhere between both camps it has elements deserving of high praise but is inarguably too long with pacing structural and narrative issues galore based on the nonfiction novel of the same name by david grann the film centers on emmet burkhart a simpleminded world war i veteran who returns to the osage nation to the home of his uncle william king hale there emmet falls for an osage named mollie who his uncle tells him is set to inherit much of her peoples oil headrights meanwhile someone is killing off the wealthy osage in the area and it looks like mollies family might be nexton paper it sounds like a fascinating exciting picture with dashes of psychological intrigue however scorseses version of the tale is dour swollen and predictable granns riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed lacking any kind of suspense or momentum screenwriters scorsese and eric roth cram too much into the narrative namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa they have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly which they dont do preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play outhad scorsese and longtime collaborator thelma schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth things could have been different there are some brilliant sequences in the movie in fact the first third is engaging and intriguing the mystery is successfully set up the location established and the characters introduced then things start going downhill the pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime until the end of course when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion beyond pacing there are some fundamental flaws editingwise that are inexplicable considering scorsese and schoonmakers prestigefor example seemingly important characters are introduced then disappear for long stretches of time similarly the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times or overlooked leaving us in the dark furthermore at times cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak all this including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative is amateur work far below scorsese and schoonmakers levelthis is not to say however that killers of the flower moon is without redeeming elements to make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation no matter its effectiveness scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the osage people the film doesnt explore the historical or cultural context of the osage nation nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivorsscorsese and roths narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the osage or the systemic injustice that they face their characterisation lacks depth or nuance relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes had he focused on the perspective and agency of the osage rather than the corrupt inept white characters scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his handsconversely rodrigo prietos cinematography is evocative and enchanting it makes for a stunning watch proving scorseses eye for visuals has not been blinded under scorseses direction prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the oklahoma landscape astutely while jack fisks detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness which adam williss set decoration and jacqueline wests costume design only compoundsmoreover the late great robbie robertsons score is striking bearing a resemblance to the work of ry cooder full of sleazy slide guitars and indian chants it complements the narrative perfectly the inclusion of periodaccurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism which in the times of baz luhrmann who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces is most welcome the last project robertson worked on before his death his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansongleonardo dicaprio stars as emmet alongside lily gladstone as mollie and robert deniro as king hale dicaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances but here takes a page out of the daniel day lewis playbook the most intense acting must surely be the best dicaprio spends the whole film frowning scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his characters expressions and eccentricities in the first third he has a bit of range though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performanceas does lily gladstone initially she creates in mollie a nuanced and witty character who can see through people she doesnt suffer fools and we find her both compelling and captivating however after the first third of the film she becomes subservient unquestioning and dull and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being shall we say slowed down deniro for his part plays king hale like an evil george burns manipulative darkly funny and morally bereft anytime hes on screen the film is a joy hes the best thing about itthey are supported by a large cast of talented actors some of whom do great work ty mitchell is excellent as john a poor man drawn into emmet and king hales plans who has more dignity then the both of them combined jesse plemons does typically fine work as fbi man tom white while louis cancelmi is seedily slick as kelsie morrison a stooge of king hales on the other hand the likes of cara jade myers as mollies alcoholic sister and brendan fraser in a thankfully small role as king hales lawyer are both so miscast and over the top they distract from everything going on around themits a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a dean martin song the money song from  them that have it get more of it the less they need it the more they love it such is the thesis of the film greed spreads like a plague and the richer you are the greedier you are its not original nor is it profound this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in  in mervyn leroys the fbi storyat the end of the day killers of the flower moon is a truncated adaptation of a great nonfiction book overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message despite

"killers of the flower moon (2023)","killers of the flower moon","cinemaserf","i feel like i watched a different movie from many of the reviews i went to the theater with high expectationsthe movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners only this story is different  its not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes its taking the land through marriage murder and inheritance the movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working withnow for the bad it is in desperate need of editing  hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes this is not the case there is at least  hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost  minutes he is never seen before or after i felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking placethere are full conversations in the native languages with no subtitles it is incredibly irritating why does dicaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth deniro was definitely miscast and should retire time passes over a period of days months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed and a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal it left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkenedsadly i would not recommend this movie",2023-10-18,NA

discover that he is now being offered  and a movie deal for the rights to his storyit can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others all too often many writers artists performers and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times of course this can yield mixed results as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process this is especially the case with the current political climate with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race sexuality and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not the film american fiction is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the worlds view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescensionfrom the very opening scene you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view we watch as monk a well educated african american university scholar has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class the book in question whose title contains a racial slur offends the young student with hair dyed neon green prompting her to question why he isnt offended along with her monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught then she can as well which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all the scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students especially from an african american perspective is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does this is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against itlater on when monk writes his book we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical african american street vernacular spoken by violent gunwielding criminals as the main characters coming from a man with such a highly educated background it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for monk to compromise what could have been a clever indepth story about two black friends but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering to his surprise monks experiment works a little too well and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone on that note perhaps the best way to describe this film is that its like a combination of mel brookss the producers and spike lees blackkklansman as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonistin addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments primarily shown through members of monks immediate family although it is shown that monk had a respectable upbringing his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today for instance his mother agnes leslie uggams suffers from early stages of alzheimers disease causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives because of this monk is forced into an ultimatum move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper pricealso monks estranged brother cliff sterling k brown has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters we later see that cliff whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay is now at odds with agnes due to her homophobic views on family values putting a strain on his relationship with her i was highly impressed with the way director cord jefferson was able to juggle all of monks family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department but jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point acrossin his best film

racial issues wishing to spend this time off with his family monk travels to boston to meet up with them and later decides to attend a literary seminar taking place nearby monks qa panel receives very little attention due to most of the attendees choosing instead to watch an onstage interview with author sintara golden issa rae whose novel wes lives in da ghetto has become a number one bestseller surprised at how much sintaras book panders to african american stereotypes yet receives such glowing praise from readers monk decides to write his own novel in the exact same style titling it my pafology and loading it up with every cliche imaginable for a black writer under the pen name stagg r leigh monk sends his completed novel to various publishers out of spite and is soon shocked to discover that he is now being offered  and a movie deal for the rights to his storyit can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others all too often many writers artists performers and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times of course this can yield mixed results as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process this is especially the case with the current political climate with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race sexuality and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not the film american fiction is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the worlds view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescensionfrom the very opening scene you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view we watch as monk a well educated african american university scholar has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class the book in question whose title contains a racial slur offends the young student with hair dyed neon green prompting her to question why he isnt offended along with her monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught then she can as well which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all the scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students especially from an african american perspective is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does this is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against itlater on when monk writes his book we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical african american street vernacular spoken by violent gunwielding criminals as the main characters coming from a man with such a highly educated background it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for monk to compromise what could have been a clever indepth story about two black friends but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering to his surprise monks experiment works a little too well and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone on that note perhaps the best way to describe this film is that its like a combination of mel brookss the producers and spike lees blackkklansman as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonistin addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments primarily shown through members of monks immediate family although it is shown that monk had a respectable upbringing his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today for instance his mother agnes leslie uggams suffers from early stages of alzheimers disease causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives because of this monk is forced into an ultimatum move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper pricealso monks estranged brother cliff sterling k brown has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters we later see that cliff whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay is now at odds with agnes due to her homophobic views on family values putting a strain on his relationship with her i was highly impressed with the way director cord jefferson was able to juggle all of monks family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department but jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point acrossin his best film performance to date jeffrey wright does a fantastic job in the role of monk several times throughout the film we witness monk react to all of the bizarre sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him and wrights facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes in the previously mentioned opening its easy to understand how irritated monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation ive always found wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years so its nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this filmworth mentioning as well is sterling k brown as cliff monks estranged homosexual younger brother what i liked most about cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to monk of the importance of staying true to himself in one scene which i wont discuss in too much detail due to spoilers we see cliff and monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself this introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film and brown definitely holds his own alongside wright during this particular moment you are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground despite all of their past disagreementstaking into account its timely subject matter cord jeffersons american fiction stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest funniest satirical films to be released in many years its so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come of course jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the films cast whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay with all that said jefferson has now established himself as a filmmaker to watch and i eagerly await any future projects he may have on the horizoni rate it a very high ",2024-02-08,NA

"american fiction (2023)","american fiction is a smart and wellcrafted film an absolute mustsee","kevinrobbins","american fiction is a comedy drama film written and directed by cord jefferson based on the novel erasure by percival everett starring jeffrey wright in the lead role it stands as one of the best written most damning satires about racial stereotypes to hit movie screens in a very long timein los angeles literature professor thelonious monk ellison jeffrey wright is placed on mandatory leave by his university after frequently arguing with his students over differing opinions on racial issues wishing to spend this time off with his family monk travels to boston to meet up with them and later decides to attend a literary seminar taking place nearby monks qa panel receives very little attention due to most of the attendees choosing instead to watch an onstage interview with author sintara golden issa rae whose novel wes lives in da ghetto has become a number one bestseller surprised at how much sintaras book panders to african american stereotypes yet receives such glowing praise from readers monk decides to write his own novel in the exact same style titling it my pafology and loading it up with every cliche imaginable for a black writer under the pen name stagg r leigh monk sends his completed novel to various publishers out of spite and is soon shocked to discover that he is now being offered  and a movie deal for the rights to his storyit can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others all too often many writers artists performers and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times of course this can yield mixed results as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process this is especially the case with the current political climate with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race sexuality and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not the film american fiction is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the worlds view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescensionfrom the very opening scene you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view we watch as monk a well educated african american university scholar has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class the book in question whose title contains a racial slur offends the young student with hair dyed neon green prompting her to question why he isnt offended along with her monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught then she can as well which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all the scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students especially from an african american perspective is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does this is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against itlater on when monk writes his book we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical african american street vernacular spoken by violent gunwielding criminals as the main characters coming from a man with such a highly educated background it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for monk to compromise what could have been a clever indepth story about two black friends but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering to his surprise monks experiment works a little too well and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone on that note perhaps the best way to describe this film is that its like a combination of mel brookss the producers and spike lees blackkklansman as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonistin addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments primarily shown through members of monks immediate family although it is shown that monk had a respectable upbringing his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today for instance his mother agnes leslie uggams suffers from early stages of alzheimers disease causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives because of this monk is forced into an ultimatum move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper pricealso monks estranged brother cliff sterling k brown has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters we later see that cliff whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay is now at odds with agnes due to her homophobic views on family values putting a strain on his relationship with her i was highly impressed with the way director cord jefferson was able to juggle all of monks family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department but jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point acrossin his best film performance to date jeffrey wright does a fantastic job in the role of monk several times throughout the film we witness monk react to all of the bizarre sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him and wrights facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes in the previously mentioned opening its easy to understand how irritated monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation ive always found wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years so its nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this filmworth mentioning as well is sterling k brown as cliff monks estranged homosexual younger brother what i liked most about cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to monk of the importance of staying true to himself in one scene which i wont discuss in too much detail due to spoilers we see cliff and monk talking about the long term

"society of the snow (2023)","a message of hope in a time of crisis","sntvcn","i first read alive at age  yeah probably too young considering its heavy subject matter that book changed my life straightup saved my life ive read that book at least  times over the years i knew all the names all the faces in the black and white photos in that winter wasteland and of course when we read we imagine we put our own visuals into our minds that best fit the narrative as we understand it thru the text on a page the tragedy the desperation and the horror is what stands out at face value and it is a horrific story but unfortunately most people know this story due to the consumption of human flesh to survive but i assure you this is not what this story is about and it never has been the truth is the story of the survivors of the andes is a love story the love for family the love for friends the love for life the story of alive isnt about death so make no mistake and at my lowest points when i thought all was lost this is the story that would creep into my mind and i would imagine theres that word again imagine what it mustve been like to be on the side of that mountain on that glacier in that reallife scenario having to eat my dead friends as i freeze knowing im starving to death watching my brothers starve to death dying from their injuries freezing  up in the andes and no one is looking for you you know the search has been called off  and im trying to imagine that to visualize that because real people lived this experienced this and its almost too much to comprehend to visualize and imagine what that was like not only the outward visual what you see with your eyes the plane the mountain the scene but also the emotion of that experience how do you really ever understand the emotional aspect of such a terrible tragedy the emotion involved in such desperate times thats key here how do you imagine that you cant really if you didnt experience itimaginein   years after i first read the book frank marshall released his version of alive in film form with ethan hawke and i was beyond excited but it failed to capture the emotion of the story and for me it pretty much failed in all aspects a hollywoodized version of the book a complete let down if you havent seen it dont bother i think it kinda sucks it didnt capture what i had imagined it fell flat in my opinion but that was as good as it getseven on the edge of life and death the part of the story that always really stood out to me was in the midst of all that sorrow and pain physical and mental the survivors never lost sight of the natural beauty that surrounded their crashed plane their home in hell the majesty of those mountains with its sharp black rocks the size of buildings reaching to the heavens it was a sight i needed to see with my own eyes i needed to stand in person where that plane had come to a stop broken and twisted i needed to see what they saw i needed to sleep there for a night just to experience  of the story of alive if there was one place on earth i needed to visit it was the valley of tears in argentina high up in the andes one of the most remote places on the planetso i did in january it is probably the most miserable night of my life cold windy hard to breathe because of the altitude couldnt sleep for more than a halfhour at a clip and i wouldnt change it for the world it was here on this trip to south america where i we met alive survivor eduardo strauch urioste he was part of the trip part of our group he accompanied us from the start in mendoza  of us in total and as we stood as a group on that hallowed ground where the crashed plane once rested i was able to see that majesty of those mountains that  headwall to the west the elongated rectangular famous rock in the photos behind the plane i was able to see the thousands of stars in the sky at night not hampered by the lights of civilization the glow of the endless snow in a location shrouded in blackness and even then i would try to imagine the airplane the conversations of the survivors the sickening dread of being the last man alive the sole survivor possibly losing all sanity until he too is gone to the elements forever nothing more than a memoryimagineyou cannot i could not even spending time in that exact location with a man who lived it who encouraged the questions from a bunch of strangers nothing off limits because one doesnt go to this place on a whim you go to this place because it draws you there it invades your mind invades your heart it wont let go and it pulls you there we all had our demons that led us to this place its a place of salvation it calls you in yet i still could not truly imagine envision the reality of those  days in imagineand then after waiting for  years  yes  years  since i read that book as a boy director j a bayona delivers the film society of the snow and i no longer have to try to imagine as ive now seen it on film on a big theater screen and it is intense unlike the first  film this film has character development prior to boarding the illfated flt  and it includes everyone survivors and deceased as it shouldokay the plane crash itself you wont find a more horrific one on film i remember my knees actually shaking when the pilot is trying to pull up the sound of the roaring engines the fear on the faces of the actors the passengers and then impact and no imagining in the world lives up to this scene in the movie horrifyingly real from both outside and inside the plane  the accuracy of the crashed plane itself is almost exact if not totally exact i put pics of the real plane against the movie plane and it is astonshing how accurate that crashed movie plane is to the real thing i no longer have to imagine what it looked like in motion as if i were walking around it because this film does that for us i bring this up first because of course the airplane plays a central role and is the one central material object in fact the detail of this entire film is accurate down to their clothing sunglassesand of course that leads to the mountains because if you saw the  film you would know that didnt look anything like the real place it looked like the canadian rockies because they were not this movie what you see onscreen is the real location where this story takes place everything you see in those mountains surrounding that plane is the real place you want realism accuracy well society of the snow delivers this with perfect detailmakeup if this film doesnt win awards for makeup someone on the awards board needs to be fired this isnt im ethan hawke and i wont grow a beard bs these actors literally look like theyve been starving on the side of a mountain their faces burned by the sun the blistered lips the filth from being stranded for two months the injuries sustained in the crash this is not a bloody gory film nor does it need to be but you do not doubt that these men have been stranded for over two months the realism again leaves little to imagine and thats why were at this movie right to live this story as close as we can for those of us who were not there cinematography the andes are huge and this film captures the immense size of these mountains this location the distances so vast so far and ive been there so i can say on the big screen it does what is intended to show the size and remoteness of these mountains with that little unseen spec of a plane lost and invisible in the glaring white of snow and ice another thing the cinematography captures well is temperature this isnt a little snow machine the film crew used but instead you feel the cold you feel the frozen nights you feel the wind you feel the suffering of what you see on the screen and in my mind probably the most important part of this film you get to see the emotion behind the consumption of the bodies the inner battle they had to face together the pain of the situation that drove them to do the unthinkable but as nando parrado once said in a documentary the human brain will elevate you to heights you didnt believe were possible to survive had you been there you would have been one of us doing what we did no less truth has ever been spoken this is of course a hard decision but to see it played out with such competent actors on a crashed plane set that is an exact copy of the real thing with the expressions of the fear of this act and the revulsion cannot be denied this movie does not bring in the camera to the see the use of the knife nor should it out of respect to all involved families of the deceased and the film doesnt need to you know what is going on from afar and im glad there is no sensationalism of this part of the story but based in truth and the actors really pull this off well we feel for them we see their pain in what they must do to survive and it is heartwrenchingno more imagining this is the film ive waited  years to see  stars aplus and all that sorrow joy and everything in between you dont leave this film without it having an impact on you its not fiction",2024-01-04,NA

my opinion but that was as good as it getseven on the edge of life and death the part of the story that always really stood out to me was in the midst of all that sorrow and pain physical and mental the survivors never lost sight of the natural beauty that surrounded their crashed plane their home in hell the majesty of those mountains with its sharp black rocks the size of buildings reaching to the heavens it was a sight i needed to see with my own eyes i needed to stand in person where that plane had come to a stop broken and twisted i needed to see what they saw i needed to sleep there for a night just to experience  of the story of alive if there was one place on earth i needed to visit it was the valley of tears in argentina high up in the andes one of the most remote places on the planetso i did in january it is probably the most miserable night of my life cold windy hard to breathe because of the altitude couldnt sleep for more than a halfhour at a clip and i wouldnt change it for the world it was here on this trip to south america where i we met alive survivor eduardo strauch urioste he was part of the trip part of our group he accompanied us from the start in mendoza  of us in total and as we stood as a group on that hallowed ground where the crashed plane once rested i was able to see that majesty of those mountains that  headwall to the west the elongated rectangular famous rock in the photos behind the plane i was able to see the thousands of stars in the sky at night not hampered by the lights of civilization the glow of the endless snow in a location shrouded in blackness and even then i would try to imagine the airplane the conversations of the survivors the sickening dread of being the last man alive the sole survivor possibly losing all sanity until he too is gone to the elements forever nothing more than a memoryimagineyou cannot i could not even spending time in that exact location with a man who lived it who encouraged the questions from a bunch of strangers nothing off limits because one doesnt go to this place on a whim you go to this place because it draws you there it invades your mind invades your heart it wont let go and it pulls you there we all had our demons that led us to this place its a place of salvation it calls you in yet i still could not truly imagine envision the reality of those  days in imagineand then after waiting for  years  yes  years  since i read that book as a boy director j a bayona delivers the film society of the snow and i no longer have to try to imagine as ive now seen it on film on a big theater screen and it is intense unlike the first  film this film has character development prior to boarding the illfated flt  and it includes everyone survivors and deceased as it shouldokay the plane crash itself you wont find a more horrific one on film i remember my knees actually shaking when the pilot is trying to pull up the sound of the roaring engines the fear on the faces of the actors the passengers and then impact and no imagining in the world lives up to this scene in the movie horrifyingly real from both outside and inside the plane  the accuracy of the crashed plane itself is almost exact if not totally exact i put pics of the real plane against the movie plane and it is astonshing how accurate that crashed movie plane is to the real thing i no longer have to imagine what it looked like in motion as if i were walking around it because this film does that for us i bring this up first because of course the airplane plays a central role and is the one central material object in fact the detail of this entire film is accurate down to their clothing sunglassesand of course that leads to the mountains because if you saw the  film you would know that didnt look anything like the real place it looked like the canadian rockies because they were not this movie what you see onscreen is the real location where this story takes place everything you see in those mountains surrounding that plane is the real place you want realism accuracy well society of the snow delivers this with perfect detailmakeup if this film doesnt win awards for makeup someone on the awards board needs to be fired this isnt im ethan hawke and i wont grow a beard bs these actors literally look like theyve been starving on the side of a mountain their faces burned by the sun the blistered lips the filth from being stranded for two months the injuries sustained in the crash this is not a bloody gory film nor does it need to be but you do not doubt that these men have been stranded for over two months the realism again leaves little to imagine and thats why were at this movie right to live this story as close as we can for those of us who were not there cinematography the andes are huge and this film captures the immense size of these mountains this location the distances so vast so far and ive been there so i can say on the big screen it does what is intended to show the size and remoteness of these mountains with that little unseen spec of a plane lost and invisible in the glaring white of snow and ice another thing the cinematography captures well is temperature this isnt a little snow machine the film crew used but instead you feel the cold you feel the frozen nights you feel the wind you feel the suffering of what you see on the screen and in my mind probably the most important part of this film you get to see the emotion behind the consumption of the bodies the inner battle they had to face together the pain of the situation that drove them to do the unthinkable but as nando parrado once said in a documentary the human brain will elevate you to heights you didnt believe were possible to survive had you been there you would have been one of us doing what we did no less truth has ever been spoken this is of course a hard decision but to see it played out with such competent actors on a crashed plane set that is an exact copy of the real thing with the expressions of the fear of this act and the revulsion cannot be denied this movie does not bring in the camera to the see the use of the knife nor should it out of respect to all involved families of the deceased and the film doesnt need to you know what is going on from afar and im glad there is no sensationalism of this part of the story but based in truth and the actors really pull this off well we feel for them we see their pain in what they must do to survive and it is heartwrenchingno more imagining this is the film ive waited  years to see  stars aplus and all that sorrow joy and everything in between you dont leave this film without it having an impact on you its not fiction",2024-01-04,NA

straightup saved my life ive read that book at least  times over the years i knew all the names all the faces in the black and white photos in that winter wasteland and of course when we read we imagine we put our own visuals into our minds that best fit the narrative as we understand it thru the text on a page the tragedy the desperation and the horror is what stands out at face value and it is a horrific story but unfortunately most people know this story due to the consumption of human flesh to survive but i assure you this is not what this story is about and it never has been the truth is the story of the survivors of the andes is a love story the love for family the love for friends the love for life the story of alive isnt about death so make no mistake and at my lowest points when i thought all was lost this is the story that would creep into my mind and i would imagine theres that word again imagine what it mustve been like to be on the side of that mountain on that glacier in that reallife scenario having to eat my dead friends as i freeze knowing im starving to death watching my brothers starve to death dying from their injuries freezing  up in the andes and no one is looking for you you know the search has been called off  and im trying to imagine that to visualize that because real people lived this experienced this and its almost too much to comprehend to visualize and imagine what that was like not only the outward visual what you see with your eyes the plane the mountain the scene but also the emotion of that experience how do you really ever understand the emotional aspect of such a terrible tragedy the emotion involved in such desperate times thats key here how do you imagine that you cant really if you didnt experience itimaginein

"society of the snow (2023)","a message of hope in a time of crisis","sntvcn","i first read alive at age  yeah probably too young considering its heavy subject matter that book changed my life straightup saved my life ive read that book at least  times over the years i knew all the names all the faces in the black and white photos in that winter wasteland and of course when we read we imagine we put our own visuals into our minds that best fit the narrative as we understand it thru the text on a page the tragedy the desperation and the horror is what stands out at face value and it is a horrific story but unfortunately most people know this story due to the consumption of human flesh to survive but i assure you this is not what this story is about and it never has been the truth is the story of the survivors of the andes is a love story the love for family the love for friends the love for life the story of alive isnt about death so make no mistake and at my lowest points when i thought all was lost this is the story that would creep into my mind and i would imagine theres that word again imagine what it mustve been like to be on the side of that mountain on that glacier in that reallife scenario having to eat my dead friends as i freeze knowing im starving to death watching my brothers starve to death dying from their injuries freezing  up in the andes and no one is looking for you you know the search has been called off  and im trying to imagine that to visualize that because real people lived this experienced this and its almost too much to comprehend to visualize and imagine what that was like not only the outward visual what you see with your eyes the plane the mountain the scene but also the emotion of that experience how do you really ever understand the emotional aspect of such a terrible tragedy the emotion involved in such desperate times thats key here how do you imagine that you cant really if you didnt experience itimaginein   years after i first read the book frank marshall released his version of alive in film form with ethan hawke and i was beyond excited but it failed to capture the emotion of the story and for me it pretty much failed in all aspects a hollywoodized version of the book a complete let down if you havent seen it dont bother i think it kinda sucks it didnt capture what i had imagined it fell flat in my opinion but that was as good as it getseven on the edge of life and death the part of the story that always really stood out to me was in the midst of all that sorrow and pain physical and mental the survivors never lost sight of the natural beauty that surrounded their crashed plane their home in hell the majesty of those mountains with its sharp black rocks the size of buildings reaching to the heavens it was a sight i needed to see with my own eyes i needed to stand in person where that plane had come to a stop broken and twisted i needed to see what they saw i needed to sleep there for a night just to experience  of the story of alive if there was one place on earth i needed to visit it was the valley of tears in argentina high up in the andes one of the most remote places on the planetso i did in january it is probably the most miserable night of my life cold windy hard to breathe because of the altitude couldnt sleep for more than a halfhour at a clip and i wouldnt change it for the world it was here on this trip to south america where i we met alive survivor eduardo strauch urioste he was part of the trip part of our group he accompanied us from the start in mendoza  of us in total and as we stood as a group on that hallowed ground where the crashed plane once rested i was able to see that majesty of those mountains that  headwall to the west the elongated rectangular famous rock in the photos behind the plane i was able to see the thousands of stars in the sky at night not hampered by the lights of civilization the glow of the endless snow in a location shrouded in blackness and even then i would try to imagine the airplane the conversations of the survivors the sickening dread of being the last man alive the sole survivor possibly losing all sanity until he too is gone to the elements forever nothing more than a memoryimagineyou cannot i could not even spending time in that exact location with a man who lived it who encouraged the questions from a bunch of strangers nothing off limits because one doesnt go to this place on a whim you go to this place because it draws you there it invades your mind invades your heart it wont let go and it pulls you there we all had our demons that led us to this place its a place of salvation it calls you in yet i still could not truly imagine envision the reality of those  days in imagineand then after waiting for  years  yes  years  since i read that book as a boy director j a bayona delivers the film society of the snow and i no longer have to try to imagine as ive now seen it on film on a big theater screen and it is intense unlike the first  film this film has character development prior to boarding the illfated flt  and it includes everyone survivors and deceased as it shouldokay the plane crash itself you wont find a more horrific one on film i remember my knees actually shaking when the pilot is trying to pull up the sound of the roaring engines the fear on the faces of the actors the passengers and then impact and no imagining in the world lives up to this scene in the movie horrifyingly real from both outside and inside the plane  the accuracy of the crashed plane itself is almost exact if not totally exact i put pics of the real plane against the movie plane and it is astonshing how accurate that crashed movie plane is to the real thing i no longer have to imagine what it looked like in motion as if i were walking around it because this film does that for us i bring this up first because of course the airplane plays a central role and is the one central material object in fact the detail of this entire film is accurate down to their clothing sunglassesand of course that leads to the mountains because if you saw the  film you would know that didnt look anything like the real place it looked like the canadian rockies because they were not this movie what you see onscreen is the real location where this story takes place everything you see in those mountains surrounding that plane is the real place you want realism accuracy well society of the snow delivers this with perfect detailmakeup if this film doesnt win awards for makeup someone on the awards board needs to be fired this isnt im ethan hawke and i wont grow a beard bs these actors literally look like theyve been starving on the side of a mountain their faces burned by the sun the blistered lips the filth from being stranded for two months the injuries sustained in the crash this is not a bloody gory film nor does it need to be but you do not doubt that these men have been stranded for over two months the realism again leaves little to imagine and thats why were at this movie right to live this story as close as we can for those of us who were not there cinematography the andes are huge and this film captures the immense size of these mountains this location the distances so vast so far and ive been there so i can say on the big screen it does what is intended to show the size and remoteness of these mountains with that little unseen spec of a plane lost and invisible in the glaring white of snow and ice another thing the cinematography captures well is temperature this isnt a little snow machine the film crew used but instead you feel the cold you feel the frozen nights you feel the wind you feel the suffering of what you see on the screen and in my mind probably the most important part of this film you get to see the emotion behind the consumption of the bodies the inner battle they had to face together the pain of the situation that drove them to do the unthinkable but as nando parrado once said in a documentary the human brain will elevate you to heights you didnt believe were possible to survive had you been there you would have been one of us doing what we did no less truth has ever been spoken this is of course a hard decision but to see it played out with such competent actors on a crashed plane set that is an exact copy of the real thing with the expressions of the fear of this act and the revulsion cannot be denied this movie does not bring in the camera to the see the use of the knife nor should it out of respect to all involved families of the deceased and the film doesnt need to you know what is going on from afar and im glad there is no sensationalism of this part of the story but based in truth and the actors really pull this off well we feel for them we see their pain in what they must do to survive and it is heartwrenchingno more imagining this is the film ive waited  years to see  stars aplus and all that sorrow joy and everything in between you dont leave this film without it having an impact on you its not fiction",2024-01-04,NA

"american fiction (2023)","american fiction is a smart and wellcrafted film an absolute mustsee","kevinrobbins","american fiction is a comedy drama film written and directed by cord jefferson based on the novel erasure by percival everett starring jeffrey wright in the lead role it stands as one of the best written most damning satires about racial stereotypes to hit movie screens in a very long timein los angeles literature professor thelonious monk ellison jeffrey wright is placed on mandatory leave by his university after frequently arguing with his students over differing opinions on racial issues wishing to spend this time off with his family monk travels to boston to meet up with them and later decides to attend a literary seminar taking place nearby monks qa panel receives very little attention due to most of the attendees choosing instead to watch an onstage interview with author sintara golden issa rae whose novel wes lives in da ghetto has become a number one bestseller surprised at how much sintaras book panders to african american stereotypes yet receives such glowing praise from readers monk decides to write his own novel in the exact same style titling it my pafology and loading it up with every cliche imaginable for a black writer under the pen name stagg r leigh monk sends his completed novel to various publishers out of spite and is soon shocked to discover that he is now being offered  and a movie deal for the rights to his storyit can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others all too often many writers artists performers and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times of course this can yield mixed results as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process this is especially the case with the current political climate with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race sexuality and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not the film american fiction is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the worlds view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescensionfrom the very opening scene you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view we watch as monk a well educated african american university scholar has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class the book in question whose title contains a racial slur offends the young student with hair dyed neon green prompting her to question why he isnt offended along with her monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught then she can as well which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all the scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students especially from an african american perspective is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does this is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against itlater on when monk writes his book we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical african american street vernacular spoken by violent gunwielding criminals as the main characters coming from a man with such a highly educated background it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for monk to compromise what could have been a clever indepth story about two black friends but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering to his surprise monks experiment works a little too well and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone on that note perhaps the best way to describe this film is that its like a combination of mel brookss the producers and spike lees blackkklansman as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonistin addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments primarily shown through members of monks immediate family although it is shown that monk had a respectable upbringing his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today for instance his mother agnes leslie uggams suffers from early stages of alzheimers disease causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives because of this monk is forced into an ultimatum move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper pricealso monks estranged brother cliff sterling k brown has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters we later see that cliff whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay is now at odds with agnes due to her homophobic views on family values putting a strain on his relationship with her i was highly impressed with the way director cord jefferson was able to juggle all of monks family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department but jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point acrossin his best film performance to date jeffrey wright does a fantastic job in the role of monk several times throughout the film we witness monk react to all of the bizarre sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him and wrights facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes in the previously mentioned opening its easy to understand how irritated monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation ive always found wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years so its nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this filmworth mentioning as well is sterling k brown as cliff monks estranged homosexual younger brother what i liked most about cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to monk of the importance of staying true to himself in one scene which i wont discuss in too much detail due to spoilers we see cliff and monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself this introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film and brown definitely holds his own alongside wright during this particular moment you are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground despite all of their past disagreementstaking into account its timely subject matter cord jeffersons american fiction stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest funniest satirical films to be released in many years its so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come of course jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the films cast whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay with all that said jefferson has now established himself as a filmmaker to watch and i eagerly await any future projects he may have on the horizoni rate it a very high ",2024-02-08,NA

the novel erasure by percival everett starring jeffrey wright in the lead role it stands as one of the best written most damning satires about racial stereotypes to hit movie screens in a very long timein los angeles literature professor thelonious monk ellison jeffrey wright is placed on mandatory leave by his university after frequently arguing with his students over differing opinions on racial issues wishing to spend this time off with his family monk travels to boston to meet up with them and later decides to attend a literary seminar taking place nearby monks qa panel receives very little attention due to most of the attendees choosing instead to watch an onstage interview with author sintara golden issa rae whose novel wes lives in da ghetto has become a number one bestseller surprised at how much sintaras book panders to african american stereotypes yet receives such glowing praise from readers monk decides to write his own novel in the exact same style titling it my pafology and loading it up with every cliche imaginable for a black writer under the pen name stagg r leigh monk sends his completed novel to various publishers out of spite and is soon shocked to discover that he is now being offered  and a movie deal for the rights to his storyit can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others all too often many writers artists performers and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times of course this can yield mixed results as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process this is especially the case with the current political climate with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race sexuality and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not the film american fiction is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the worlds view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescensionfrom the very opening scene you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view we watch as monk a well educated african american university scholar has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class the book in question whose title contains a racial slur offends the young student with hair dyed neon green prompting her to question why he isnt offended along with her monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught then she can as well which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all the scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students especially from an african american perspective is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does this is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against itlater on when monk writes his book we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical african american street vernacular spoken by violent gunwielding criminals as the main characters coming from a man with such a highly educated background it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for monk to compromise what could have been a clever indepth story about two black friends but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering to his surprise monks experiment works a little too well and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone on that note perhaps the best way to describe this film is that its like a combination of mel brookss the producers and spike lees blackkklansman as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonistin addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments primarily shown through members of monks immediate family although it is shown that monk had a respectable upbringing his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today for instance his mother agnes leslie uggams suffers from early stages of alzheimers disease causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives because of this monk is forced into an ultimatum move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper pricealso monks estranged brother cliff sterling k brown has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters we later see that cliff whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay is now at odds with agnes due to her homophobic views on family values putting a strain on his relationship with her i was highly impressed with the way director cord jefferson was able to juggle all of monks family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department but jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point acrossin his best film performance to date jeffrey wright does a fantastic job in the role of monk several times throughout the film we witness monk react to all of the bizarre sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him and wrights facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes in the previously mentioned opening its easy to understand how irritated monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation ive always found wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years so its nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this filmworth mentioning as well is sterling k brown as cliff monks estranged homosexual younger brother what i liked most about cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to monk of the importance of staying true to himself in one scene which i wont discuss in too much detail due to spoilers we see cliff and monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself this introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film and brown definitely holds his own alongside wright during this particular moment you are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground despite all of their past disagreementstaking into account its timely subject matter cord jeffersons american fiction stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest funniest satirical films to be released in many years its so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come of course jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the films cast whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay with all that said jefferson has now established himself as a

racial issues wishing to spend this time off with his family monk travels to boston to meet up with them and later decides to attend a literary seminar taking place nearby monks qa panel receives very little attention due to most of the attendees choosing instead to watch an onstage interview with author sintara golden issa rae whose novel wes lives in da ghetto has become a number one bestseller surprised at how much sintaras book panders to african american stereotypes yet receives such glowing praise from readers monk decides to write his own novel in the exact same style titling it my pafology and loading it up with every cliche imaginable for a black writer under the pen name stagg r leigh monk sends his completed novel to various publishers out of spite and is soon shocked to discover that he is now being offered  and a movie deal for the rights to his storyit can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others all too often many writers artists performers and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times of course this can yield mixed results as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process this is especially the case with the current political climate with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race sexuality and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not the film american fiction is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the worlds view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescensionfrom the very opening scene you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view we watch as monk a well educated african american university scholar has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class the book in question whose title contains a racial slur offends the young student with hair dyed neon green prompting her to question why he isnt offended along with her monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught then she can as well which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all the scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students especially from an african american perspective is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does this is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against itlater on when monk writes his book we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical african american street vernacular spoken by violent gunwielding criminals as the main characters coming from a man with such a highly educated background it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for monk to compromise what could have been a clever indepth story about two black friends but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering to his surprise monks experiment works a little too well and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone on that note perhaps the best way to describe this film is that its like a combination of mel brookss the producers and spike lees blackkklansman as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonistin addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments primarily shown through members of monks immediate family although it is shown that monk had a respectable upbringing his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today for instance his mother agnes leslie uggams suffers from early stages of alzheimers disease causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives because of this monk is forced into an ultimatum move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper pricealso monks estranged brother cliff sterling k brown has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters we later see that cliff whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay is now at odds with agnes due to her homophobic views on family values putting a strain on his relationship with her i was highly impressed with the way director cord jefferson was able to juggle all of monks family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department but jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point acrossin his best film performance to date jeffrey wright does a fantastic job in the role of monk several times throughout the film we witness monk react to all of the bizarre sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him and wrights facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes in the previously mentioned opening its easy to understand how irritated monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation ive always found wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years so its nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this filmworth mentioning as well is sterling k brown as cliff monks estranged homosexual younger brother what i liked most about cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to monk of the importance of staying true to himself in one scene which i wont discuss in too much detail due to spoilers we see cliff and monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself this introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film and brown definitely holds his own alongside wright during this particular moment you are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground despite all of their past disagreementstaking into account

"talk to me (i) (2022)","great premise subpar execution","manuelasaez","the premise was what initially drew me to this film although its not that different from similar movies in the genre replacing the ouija board with a ceramic hand was a creative and unique touch that the horror genre needs more of and for that alone this movie deserves some recognition creativity and ingenuity are the two elements that the horror genre is sorely lacking and its great to see how the new generation is utilizing premises that have been done countless times before and giving them an unexpected spin that being said thats about the only thing about this movie that is worth praisingif youve ever seen a movie about demonic possession spirit conjuring or communicating with the dead via an ouija board youve already seen this film aside from the method being used this has been done plenty of times before and at times i found myself wondering if the people who made this have ever seen a movie in the genre before because almost every idea was ripped form some other movie there were so many ways you could have made this movie truly ingenious but they kept it safe and did the basic lets gather a bunch of teens together to communicate with the dead that has already been done to death so many times i wish they would have pushed the envelope going for stuff that was more shocking instead of treading familiar ground its what made me ultimately not care much about what transpired in the filmthe nail on the coffin was the cast though filling a movie with insufferable and unlikable teenagers and young adults completely removed me from the experience similar to bodies bodies bodies the cast was a bunch of tryhard teenagers with nasty attitudes poor behavior and partaking in degenerate behavior that always sits very poorly with me im so glad i neither had friends like any of these people and that i never had the misfortune of interacting with anyone who behaved this badly in my youth i believe the movie would have been more effective with an adult cast but thats just my personal tasteoverall a novel concept with mediocre execution makes for a somewhat entertaining film that i didnt regret watching but that i really cant be bothered to recommend aside from one scene that was really effective in instilling fear and dread the rest of the movie is a retread of every ouija board film youve ever seen where a movie like smile brings something new and original to the genre talk to me just brings the same old concepts in the palm of a new hand",2023-09-13,NA

"the pacific (2010)","left me devastated","gogoschka","im guessing most of us watched the pacific for at least one of the following  reasons we have an interest in history particularly in ww we are fans of movies and television shows well the good ones anyway we had seen  and loved  the previous hanksspielberg coproduction band of brothers and expected a miniseries on the same levelnow from reading some of the reviews here i gather that third reason was the most important one for many viewers  and its also why the pacific apparently left quite a few people disappointed as for me i wasnt disappointed  i was devastatedim a lucky man ive never had to suffer through a war but i had relatives who did and though theyre all long gone now ill never forget their stories war is the most extreme and outrageous experience humans can possibly endure but there are many different aspects and layers to it because a war is not a single experience its all the experiences of all the individuals who have to suffer through it and no single film or tv show can cover all of them band of brothers focused on certain aspects of a war and it chose a narrative that helped emphasize what the core theme of the series was the brotherhood of war it was about people who retain their humanity and form the closest of bonds under the worst most horrific circumstancesthat inherently human element in bob was also why we could identify so well with the protagonists and why we were  and still are  so deeply touched by what they had to go through its an outstandingly well made series and i cant imagine how those experiences by those soldiers could have been portrayed better which is why the pacific doesnt even try instead it goes almost in the opposite direction by choosing to focus on the sheer insanity of war the relentless horror and despair of people losing their humanity and their struggle to regain it of course just like bob its also about the heroic sacrifices of those brave soldiers but if there is a core theme in the pacific its that of trauma the trauma of having your humanity stripped from you and your personality shattered the trauma of witnessing the complete disintegration of everything you thought you were and knowing youll never be whole againwhat we see in the pacific is hell plain and simple its scores and scores of anonymous young japanese soldiers running senselessly into machine gun fire wave after wave until the piles of their bodies are so high they block the sight for the machine gun its american soldiers barely older than kids in despair or completely numb from the sheer amount of random death around them its vibrant young men turning into barely alive husks whose only remaining focus is to survive  which means they have to kill other barely alive young men who will stop at nothing to kill them in turn its kids killing other kids like rats by any means at their disposal guns knives flamethrowers or with their bare hands its people living among the rotting corpses of their dead comrades and enemies and completely losing any regard for human life and the few moments where we witness how those kids get a brief taste of how precious and beautiful life could be make their fate all the more heartbreakingover large stretches the pacific is devastating and depressing to watch and though i found it never less than compelling its actually easy to see why many viewers who had hoped for a similarly engaging experience as in bob were left disappointed but this is a different story about different people who fought in a different theater of the war and who went through different experiences and once you stop comparing it to the story of the men in easy company from bob youll find that while different in terms of sheer quality the pacific is every bit as good and as much of an outstanding achievement as its more popular predecessorthe realism the performances the music and the production values in the series are superb this was a  million production after all and the attention to historic detail is simply staggering as for me witnessing what these men went through left me devastated yet i am grateful ive watched the pacifc because in its relentless depiction of the horrors of war it honors the sacrifice these brave young soldiers made in the hope future generations wouldnt have to do the same i originally rated this series  stars out of  but upon a recent rewatch and with more knowledge of the war in the pacific theater its clear that this is a  outstandingfavorite films imdbcomlistmkjokvqlsbslesserknown masterpieces imdbcomlistlsfavorite tvshows reviewed imdbcomlistls",2018-07-07,NA

"the pacific (2010)","different from band of brothers","snoopystyle","the pacific is tom hanks and steven spielbergs epic  million dollar miniseries from the creators of the brilliant  series band of brothers much like with band of brothers the pacific gives us an unflinching look at the horrors of war not just the physical but the mental horrors these men must face as an audience you are pulled through this experience watching in horror as limbs are torn from bodies and men are burned and mutilated in a way even more distressing is watching the emotional scars and effects this has on our main characters this is not a perfect series and does suffer from some major flaws but overall its an extremely harrowing experience but one that is needed in an age where war is often glorified this series does anything but that narrative and overall story the pacific is based primarily on two memoirs of us marines with the old breed at peleliu and okinawa by eugene sledge and helmet for my pillow by robert leckie the miniseries follows both these marines sledge played by joe mazzello and leckie james badge dale there is also the addition of marine john basilone jon seda but he is a lesser focus now unlike band of brothers we follow these characters separately as they are part of different divisions the first few episodes follow leckie and his experiences the latter on sledge in a way this is both an interesting way of narration but also maybe the biggest flaw of the series this spilt narration gives us two very separate journeys which in a way bonds us closer to the characters the downfall is that leckies story is just simply not as interesting as sledges from the moment sledge is introduced to us i felt an instant sympathy and connection with him here is this shy awkward eighteen year old desperately longing to fight in the war but unable to do so thanks to a heart mummer of course his determination gets the best of him and enlists the character and his overall story is simply miles more compelling than leckies thats what makes the first three or four episodes somewhat lackluster when the sole focus is on sledge this series reaches its incredible potential and becomes something truly amazing sledge and his journey is really the heart and soul of this seriesacting with such a depressing and intense subject matter first class acting was expected and the pacific delivers every single cast member gives a great performance its gripping and believable acting at its best the stars are undoubtedly joe mazzello who plays sledge and rami malek who plays corporal merriell shelton or snafu a highly intriguing character who forms a close friendship with sledge both give emmy worthy performances and in maleks case i would say oscar worthy these are two very complex and incredible performances mazzello plays our lead which such an intense and subtle power his character goes from a naive and passive teenager to hardened killing machine full of rage it is an incredible character arc and mazzello plays it to perfection as the series comes to a close we really see what mazzello can do sledge is beginning to lose himself he has become ruthless and in one single pivotal scene he regains his humanity his compassion and his redemption its a truly powerful scene and one in which mazzello does not utter one word his face says everything and its heartbreaking in fact that is mazzello main strong point his ability to convey much more than what is going on just by his eyes and face there is so much complex emotion behind his eyes it makes for a fascinating watch rami malek gives the most impressive performance of the series playing snafu his character is incredibly creepy and odd obviously numbed by the horrors of the war but there is something there that makes the audience warm to him malek completely becomes the role every mannerism twitch blink of the eye is perfectly done lines such as i like to watch the new guys sweat are said with such odd intensity its actually mind blowing i will call this performance perfect which is a very rare thing indeed if only malek could win an oscar because this performance truly deserves the highest acclaim malek and mozzello also have fantastic chemistry playing off each other perfectly helping to only further this touching friendshipdirection remember the opening sequence of saving private ryan well imagine that times  i would say this is the most realistic portrayal of what an actual battle must have felt like the battle scenes are simply epic and wonderfully directed even if you hate everything else anyone can see the direction is incredible within this series overall the major flaw of this series if the first  episodes they simply dont have the emotional impact of the

"the pacific (2010)","the pacific is no band of brothers and it shouldnt be","johnmcelroynu","i couldnt tell you how many times i have watched band of brothers i think it is the best production ever made however i resisted watching the pacific my father had five years active duty in the marine corps when i was born and remained on active duty until i was  years old i was ten when he left for viet nam the first time and in high school the next i had friends whose fathers were seriously wounded or killed there i have always felt like marines are family and any depiction of them being killed has always been hard to see however i finally decided to manup and watch it on veterans day this yeari think bob was a dream come true for the producers they had ironclad characters to follow all the way through and many of the men were still alive and took part in it the story of easy company had been put into book form brilliantly they didnt have that with the pacific the closest they could come was to base it all around three separate men robert leckieeugene sledge and john basilone the three mens paths crossed somebut they did not belong to the same units or know each other although leckie and sledge both knew basilones reputation as brutal and difficult as the war in europe was the pacific war against the japanese was almost incomprehensible except for their time in australia following guadalcanal they were fighting the most brutal fights in history while in the most punishing places on earthit is a wonder that any of them were ever able to return to civilization and dull the memories of those horrors enough to lead a more or less normal life because of the brutality of both the enemy and the conditions they had to live and fight under there isnt much in the way of lightheartedness the pacific is not as enjoyable as bob anyone seeing it for the first time should not expect to be entertained it is a bit more difficult to get into i found it helpful to watch the first episode twice before going on a little patience in getting to know the primary characters payed off i also think being able to watch it all over the course of a few days like i did was much better than watching it as it was first presented one episode each week for ten weeksthere were some excellent performances in the pacific someone else singled out ravi maleks portrayal of merriel snafu sheldon as award worthy and i agree  i loved william sadler as ltcol lewis chesty puller and i was also very impressed with tom budge as pfc ronnie gibsonthe three primary characters are portrayed worthily i didnt think joe mazzello as sledge developed his character as well as the other two however i ended up with only nine episodes on my dvr the one i am missing is episode five which i suspect is centered on sledge so perhaps the character will seem better developed to me after i see it jon seda gave a fine performance as john basilone which was definitely the roll of a lifetime i think my favorite of the three was james badge dale as bob leckiei wasnt as depressed by seeing a portrayal of so many marines being killed and wounded as i expected that was partly because not many of them really looked like marines to me i have always said that you can put an actor in the marine corps uniform but you usually cant make him look like a marine there were a few though who were totally believable including jon seda others have commented on the length of the mens hair as being distracting andor inaccurate by my first memories in the midlate s marines were wearing the crewcuts and flattops that they have worn ever since however i have pictures of my dad in uniform from a decade earlier with longer hair so i think the producers knew what they were doing therealthough i agree with most posters here that the pacific is not as good as bob it is still welldone and definitely worth seeing i think watching it with an open mind and avoiding comparisons it is a good way to approach it one last comment i have is that i wonder why one young marine who was killed on iwo jima at age  was singled out in the tributes at the end i assume they meant that to symbolize the thousands of young men who were killed and it was very effective imo but i would be interested to know why they chose the one they did if perhaps someone involved in the production was a relative of the young man i wont say his name for those who might not have seen it yet but i will always remember it",2011-10-28,NA

"the pacific (2010)","the pacific is no band of brothers and it shouldnt be","johnmcelroynu","i couldnt tell you how many times i have watched band of brothers i think it is the best production ever made however i resisted watching the pacific my father had five years active duty in the marine corps when i was born and remained on active duty until i was  years old i was ten when he left for viet nam the first time and in high school the next i had friends whose fathers were seriously wounded or killed there i have always felt like marines are family and any depiction of them being killed has always been hard to see however i finally decided to manup and watch it on veterans day this yeari think bob was a dream come true for the producers they had ironclad characters to follow all the way through and many of the men were still alive and took part in it the story of easy company had been put into book form brilliantly they didnt have that with the pacific the closest they could come was to base it all around three separate men robert leckieeugene sledge and john basilone the three mens paths crossed somebut they did not belong to the same units or know each other although leckie and sledge both knew basilones reputation as brutal and difficult as the war in europe was the pacific war against the japanese was almost incomprehensible except for their time in australia following guadalcanal they were fighting the most brutal fights in history while in the most punishing places on earthit is a wonder that any of them were ever able to return to civilization and dull the memories of those horrors enough to lead a more or less normal life because of the brutality of both the enemy and the conditions they had to live and fight under there isnt much in the way of lightheartedness the pacific is not as enjoyable as bob anyone seeing it for the first time should not expect to be entertained it is a bit more difficult to get into i found it helpful to watch the first episode twice before going on a little patience in getting to know the primary characters payed off i also think being able to watch it all over the course of a few days like i did was much better than watching it as it was first presented one episode each week for ten weeksthere were some excellent performances in the pacific someone else singled out ravi maleks portrayal of merriel snafu sheldon as award worthy and i agree  i loved william sadler as ltcol lewis chesty puller and i was also very impressed with tom budge as pfc ronnie gibsonthe three primary characters are portrayed worthily i didnt think joe mazzello as sledge developed his character as well as the other two however i ended up with only nine episodes on my dvr the one i am missing is episode five which i suspect is centered on sledge so perhaps the character will seem better developed to me after i see it jon seda gave a fine performance as john basilone which was definitely the roll of a lifetime i think my favorite of the three was james badge dale as bob leckiei wasnt as depressed by seeing a portrayal of so many marines being killed and wounded as i expected that was partly because not many of them really looked like marines to me i have always said that you can put an actor in the marine corps uniform but you usually cant make him look like a marine there were a few though who were totally believable including jon seda others have commented on the length of the mens hair as being distracting andor inaccurate by my first memories in the midlate s marines were wearing the crewcuts and flattops that they have worn ever since however i have pictures of my dad in uniform from a decade earlier with longer hair so i think the producers knew what they were doing therealthough i agree with most posters here that the pacific is not as good as bob it is still welldone and definitely worth seeing i think watching it with an open mind and avoiding comparisons it is a good way to approach it one last comment i have is that i wonder why one young marine who was killed on iwo jima at age  was singled out in the tributes at the end i assume they meant that to symbolize the thousands of young men who were killed and it was very effective imo but i would be interested to know why they chose the one they did if perhaps someone involved in the production was a relative of the young man i wont say his name for those who might not have seen it yet but i will always remember it",2011-10-28,NA

"the pacific (2010)","left me devastated","gogoschka","im guessing most of us watched the pacific for at least one of the following  reasons we have an interest in history particularly in ww we are fans of movies and television shows well the good ones anyway we had seen  and loved  the previous hanksspielberg coproduction band of brothers and expected a miniseries on the same levelnow from reading some of the reviews here i gather that third reason was the most important one for many viewers  and its also why the pacific apparently left quite a few people disappointed as for me i wasnt disappointed  i was devastatedim a lucky man ive never had to suffer through a war but i had relatives who did and though theyre all long gone now ill never forget their stories war is the most extreme and outrageous experience humans can possibly endure but there are many different aspects and layers to it because a war is not a single experience its all the experiences of all the individuals who have to suffer through it and no single film or tv show can cover all of them band of brothers focused on certain aspects of a war and it chose a narrative that helped emphasize what the core theme of the series was the brotherhood of war it was about people who retain their humanity and form the closest of bonds under the worst most horrific circumstancesthat inherently human element in bob was also why we could identify so well with the protagonists and why we were  and still are  so deeply touched by what they had to go through its an outstandingly well made series and i cant imagine how those experiences by those soldiers could have been portrayed better which is why the pacific doesnt even try instead it goes almost in the opposite direction by choosing to focus on the sheer insanity of war the relentless horror and despair of people losing their humanity and their struggle to regain it of course just like bob its also about the heroic sacrifices of those brave soldiers but if there is a core theme in the pacific its that of trauma the trauma of having your humanity stripped from you and your personality shattered the trauma of witnessing the complete disintegration of everything you thought you were and knowing youll never be whole againwhat we see in the pacific is hell plain and simple its scores and scores of anonymous young japanese soldiers running senselessly into machine gun fire wave after wave until the piles of their bodies are so high they block the sight for the machine gun its american soldiers barely older than kids in despair or completely numb from the sheer amount of random death around them its vibrant young men turning into barely alive husks whose only remaining focus is to survive  which means they have to kill other barely alive young men who will stop at nothing to kill them in turn its kids killing other kids like rats by any means at their disposal guns knives flamethrowers or with their bare hands its people living among the rotting corpses of their dead comrades and enemies and completely losing any regard for human life and the few moments where we witness how those kids get a brief taste of how precious and beautiful life could be make their fate all the more heartbreakingover large stretches the pacific is devastating and depressing to watch and though i found it never less than compelling its actually easy to see why many viewers who had hoped for a similarly engaging experience as in bob were left disappointed but this is a different story about different people who fought in a different theater of the war and who went through different experiences and once you stop comparing it to the story of the men in easy company from bob youll find that while different in terms of sheer quality the pacific is every bit as good and as much of an outstanding achievement as its more popular predecessorthe realism the performances the music and the production values in the series are superb this was a  million production after all and the attention to historic detail is simply staggering as for me witnessing what these men went through left me devastated yet i am grateful ive watched the pacifc because in its relentless depiction of the horrors of war it honors the sacrifice these brave young soldiers made in the hope future generations wouldnt have to do the same i originally rated this series  stars out of  but upon a recent rewatch and with more knowledge of the war in the pacific theater its clear that this is a  outstandingfavorite films imdbcomlistmkjokvqlsbslesserknown masterpieces imdbcomlistlsfavorite tvshows reviewed imdbcomlistls",2018-07-07,NA

"the pacific (2010)","different from band of brothers","snoopystyle","the pacific is tom hanks and steven spielbergs epic  million dollar miniseries from the creators of the brilliant  series band of brothers much like with band of brothers the pacific gives us an unflinching look at the horrors of war not just the physical but the mental horrors these men must face as an audience you are pulled through this experience watching in horror as limbs are torn from bodies and men are burned and mutilated in a way even more distressing is watching the emotional scars and effects this has on our main characters this is not a perfect series and does suffer from some major flaws but overall its an extremely harrowing experience but one that is needed in an age where war is often glorified this series does anything but that narrative and overall story the pacific is based primarily on two memoirs of us marines with the old breed at peleliu and okinawa by eugene sledge and helmet for my pillow by robert leckie the miniseries follows both these marines sledge played by joe mazzello and leckie james badge dale there is also the addition of marine john basilone jon seda but he is a lesser focus now unlike band of brothers we follow these characters separately as they are part of different divisions the first few episodes follow leckie and his experiences the latter on sledge in a way this is both an interesting way of narration but also maybe the biggest flaw of the series this spilt narration gives us two very separate journeys which in a way bonds us closer to the characters the downfall is that leckies story is just simply not as interesting as sledges from the moment sledge is introduced to us i felt an instant sympathy and connection with him here is this shy awkward eighteen year old desperately longing to fight in the war but unable to do so thanks to a heart mummer of course his determination gets the best of him and enlists the character and his overall story is simply miles more compelling than leckies thats what makes the first three or four episodes somewhat lackluster when the sole focus is on sledge this series reaches its incredible potential and becomes something truly amazing sledge and his journey is really the heart and soul of this seriesacting with such a depressing and intense subject matter first class acting was expected and the pacific delivers every single cast member gives a great performance its gripping and believable acting at its best the stars are undoubtedly joe mazzello who plays sledge and rami malek who plays corporal merriell shelton or snafu a highly intriguing character who forms a close friendship with sledge both give emmy worthy performances and in maleks case i would say oscar worthy these are two very complex and incredible performances mazzello plays our lead which such an intense and subtle power his character goes from a naive and passive teenager to hardened killing machine full of rage it is an incredible character arc and mazzello plays it to perfection as the series comes to a close we really see what mazzello can do sledge is beginning to lose himself he has become ruthless and in one single pivotal scene he regains his humanity his compassion and his redemption its a truly powerful scene and one in which mazzello does not utter one word his face says everything and its heartbreaking in fact that is mazzello main strong point his ability to convey much more than what is going on just by his eyes and face there is so much complex emotion behind his eyes it makes for a fascinating watch rami malek gives the most impressive performance of the series playing snafu his character is incredibly creepy and odd obviously numbed by the horrors of the war but there is something there that makes the audience warm to him malek completely becomes the role every mannerism twitch blink of the eye is perfectly done lines such as i like to watch the new guys sweat are said with such odd intensity its actually mind blowing i will call this performance perfect which is a very rare thing indeed if only malek could win an oscar because this performance truly deserves the highest acclaim malek and mozzello also have fantastic chemistry playing off each other perfectly helping to only further this touching friendshipdirection remember the opening sequence of saving private ryan well imagine that times  i would say this is the most realistic portrayal of what an actual battle must have felt like the battle scenes are simply epic and wonderfully directed even if you hate everything else anyone can see the direction is incredible within this series overall the major flaw of this series if the first  episodes they simply dont have the emotional impact of the rest in fact they border on dull however as soon as sledge and snafu become our main focus this series becomes a true epic this series will take you on a haunting experience you will be horrified you will be moved you will laugh you will cry as long as you stick with it through the first few episodes you will not regret it",2010-05-28,NA

"the pacific (2010)","left me devastated","gogoschka","im guessing most of us watched the pacific for at least one of the following  reasons we have an interest in history particularly in ww we are fans of movies and television shows well the good ones anyway we had seen  and loved  the previous hanksspielberg coproduction band of brothers and expected a miniseries on the same levelnow from reading some of the reviews here i gather that third reason was the most important one for many viewers  and its also why the pacific apparently left quite a few people disappointed as for me i wasnt disappointed  i was devastatedim a lucky man ive never had to suffer through a war but i had relatives who did and though theyre all long gone now ill never forget their stories war is the most extreme and outrageous experience humans can possibly endure but there are many different aspects and layers to it because a war is not a single experience its all the experiences of all the individuals who have to suffer through it and no single film or tv show can cover all of them band of brothers focused on certain aspects of a war and it chose a narrative that helped emphasize what the core theme of the series was the brotherhood of war it was about people who retain their humanity and form the closest of bonds under the worst most horrific circumstancesthat inherently human element in bob was also why we could identify so well with the protagonists and why we were  and still are  so deeply touched by what they had to go through its an outstandingly well made series and i cant imagine how those experiences by those soldiers could have been portrayed better which is why the pacific doesnt even try instead it goes almost in the opposite direction by choosing to focus on the sheer insanity of war the relentless horror and despair of people losing their humanity and their struggle to regain it of course just like bob its also about the heroic sacrifices of those brave soldiers but if there is a core theme in the pacific its that of trauma the trauma of having your humanity stripped from you and your personality shattered the trauma of witnessing the complete disintegration of everything you thought you were and knowing youll never be whole againwhat we see in the pacific is hell plain and simple its scores and scores of anonymous young japanese soldiers running senselessly into machine gun fire wave after wave until the piles of their bodies are so high they block the sight for the machine gun its american soldiers barely older than kids in despair or completely numb from the sheer amount of random death around them its vibrant young men turning into barely alive husks whose only remaining focus is to survive  which means they have to kill other barely alive young men who will stop at nothing to kill them in turn its kids killing other kids like rats by any means at their disposal guns knives flamethrowers or with their bare hands its people living among the rotting corpses of their dead comrades and enemies and completely losing any regard for human life and the few moments where we witness how those kids get a brief taste of how precious and beautiful life could be make their fate all the more heartbreakingover large stretches the pacific is devastating and depressing to watch and though i found it never less than compelling its actually easy to see why many viewers who had hoped for a similarly engaging experience as in bob were left disappointed but this is a different story about different people who fought in a different theater of the war and who went through different experiences and once you stop comparing it to the story of the men in easy company from bob youll find that while different in terms of sheer quality the pacific is every bit as good and as much of an outstanding achievement as its more popular predecessorthe realism the performances the music and the production values in the series are superb this was a  million production after all and the attention to historic detail is simply staggering as for me witnessing what these men went through left me devastated yet i am grateful ive watched the pacifc because in its relentless depiction of the horrors of war it honors the sacrifice these brave young soldiers made in the hope future generations wouldnt have to do the same i originally rated this series  stars out of  but upon a recent rewatch and with more knowledge of the war in the pacific theater its clear that this is a  outstandingfavorite films imdbcomlistmkjokvqlsbslesserknown masterpieces imdbcomlistlsfavorite tvshows reviewed imdbcomlistls",2018-07-07,NA

"the pacific (2010)","different from band of brothers","snoopystyle","the pacific is tom hanks and steven spielbergs epic  million dollar miniseries from the creators of the brilliant  series band of brothers much like with band of brothers the pacific gives us an unflinching look at the horrors of war not just the physical but the mental horrors these men must face as an audience you are pulled through this experience watching in horror as limbs are torn from bodies and men are burned and mutilated in a way even more distressing is watching the emotional scars and effects this has on our main characters this is not a perfect series and does suffer from some major flaws but overall its an extremely harrowing experience but one that is needed in an age where war is often glorified this series does anything but that narrative and overall story the pacific is based primarily on two memoirs of us marines with the old breed at peleliu and okinawa by eugene sledge and helmet for my pillow by robert leckie the miniseries follows both these marines sledge played by joe mazzello and leckie james badge dale there is also the addition of marine john basilone jon seda but he is a lesser focus now unlike band of brothers we follow these characters separately as they are part of different divisions the first few episodes follow leckie and his experiences the latter on sledge in a way this is both an interesting way of narration but also maybe the biggest flaw of the series this spilt narration gives us two very separate journeys which in a way bonds us closer to the characters the downfall is that leckies story is just simply not as interesting as sledges from the moment sledge is introduced to us i felt an instant sympathy and connection with him here is this shy awkward eighteen year old desperately longing to fight in the war but unable to do so thanks to a heart mummer of course his determination gets the best of him and enlists the character and his overall story is simply miles more compelling than leckies thats what makes the first three or four episodes somewhat lackluster when the sole focus is on sledge this series reaches its incredible potential and becomes something truly amazing sledge and his journey is really the heart and soul of this seriesacting with such a depressing and intense subject matter first class acting was expected and the pacific delivers every single cast member gives a great performance its gripping and believable acting at its best the stars are undoubtedly joe mazzello who plays sledge and rami malek who plays corporal merriell shelton or snafu a highly intriguing character who forms a close friendship with sledge both give emmy worthy performances and in maleks case i would say oscar worthy these are two very complex and incredible performances mazzello plays our lead which such an intense and subtle power his character goes from a naive and passive teenager to hardened killing machine full of rage it is an incredible character arc and mazzello plays it to perfection as the series comes to a close we really see what mazzello can do sledge is beginning to lose himself he has become ruthless and in one single pivotal scene he regains his humanity his compassion and his redemption its a truly powerful scene and one in which mazzello does not utter one word his face says everything and its heartbreaking in fact that is mazzello main strong point his ability to convey much more than what is going on just by his eyes and face there is so much complex emotion behind his eyes it makes for a fascinating watch rami malek gives the most impressive performance of the series playing snafu his character is incredibly creepy and odd obviously numbed by the horrors of the war but there is something there that makes the audience warm to him malek completely becomes the role every mannerism twitch blink of the eye is perfectly done lines such as i like to watch the new guys sweat are said with such odd intensity its actually mind blowing i will call this performance perfect which is a very rare thing indeed if only malek could win an oscar because this performance truly deserves the highest acclaim malek and mozzello also have fantastic chemistry playing off each other perfectly helping to only further this touching friendshipdirection remember the opening sequence of saving private ryan well imagine that times  i would say this is the most realistic portrayal of what an actual battle must have felt like the battle scenes are simply epic and wonderfully directed even if you hate everything else anyone can see the direction is incredible within this series overall the major flaw of this series if the first  episodes they simply dont have the emotional impact of the rest in fact they border on dull however as soon as sledge and snafu become our main focus this series becomes a true epic this series will take you on a haunting experience you will be horrified you

"the godfather (1972)","the greatest movie of all time","u","there is very little that i can add to the reviews on here that have explained what is so wonderful about the godfather so well i have seen many amazing movies as well as some clunkers but the godfather was beyond amazing there are so many images details and scenes that i seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago the godfather is so incredibly wellmade and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films ive seen so much so i couldnt think of a single flaw and i am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why i didnt see this film before nowtrue the godfather is a little slowmoving and the plot takes a while to unfold but neither of these are flaws as such the slow pacing added to the elegiac quality the godfather has and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you being  i was worried whether i was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it but luckily i understood it perfectly and i can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to bethe godfather for one thing looks stunning i strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film in some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen autumnal and very picturesque it is not just the cinematography that makes the godfather look stunning the costumes are beautifully tailored the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculatethen there is the score by nina rota one word outstanding i have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for the godfather this score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from francis ford coppola and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent thoughtprovoking and darkly humorous as for the violence some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop and i almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horses head in his bed but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of itthe acting is absolutely fantastic bringing to life characters that are rich and complex perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them and i have to say the godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance in particular marlon brando is brilliant as don vito very heavily disguised yet stately every word of dialogue every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged al pacinos casting was admittedly risky but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film while james caan is dignified and loyal diane keaton beautiful and alluring and robert duvall nicely understatedin conclusion absolutely amazing and i can see completely why it is considered one of the  greatest movies ever made it is that good in fact my year old brother loved it so much he wants to see it again  though this film is too good for that rating bethany cox",2008-06-21,NA

"the godfather (1972)","im finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was","thelittlesongbird","this movie is strong good script great casting excellent acting and over the top directing  it is hard to fine a movie done this well it is  years old and has aged well  even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies he or she will watch the entire film the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses  its about family loyalty greed relationships and real life  this is a great mix and the artistic style make the film memorable",2013-03-30,NA
"the godfather (1972)"," on imdbs top  a multioscarwinner and over  reviewswhat more can i say about the movie","planktonrules","im  years old and this is the first time ive watched the godfather i feel like ive missed something like i definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it shouldve there was definitely a few pointless scenes i can understand this was way ahead of its time but im obviously watching this  years late which is the reason i believe i didnt enjoy it as much as the rest of you if you read the rest of my reviews of old film i actually really enjoyed them so dont blame it on my youth ill definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and im sure ill really like that one but ive seen films ive given an  that are way better marlon won the oscar for best leading role but i think he shouldve won best supporting role and al pacino shouldve been put up for the oscar marlon wasnt in the film nearly as much as i thought hed be all in all it definitely wasnt a bad film in fact a good film but thats all just a good film",2006-10-14,NA
"the godfather (1972)","initially i wasnt a fan but then i realised","mattrochman","my nephew who is all of  told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with the godfather he doesnt believe anything made before it is of any great merit for him the godfather is like the birth of a nation all three of the godfather films can bear viewing over and over again mario puzo created such compelling characters and francis ford coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently like that other mammoth novel about a period gone with the wind mario puzo was like margaret mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was publishedanyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the godfather films case in point alex rocco who plays the minor character of moe green who takes it upon himself to slap fredo corleone around hes also got a cash flow problem at the casino hes running one would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to bugsy siegalthe godfather story begins at the end of world war ii where marlon brando rules the roost as vito corleone head of one of the large crime families two sons james caan sonny and john cazale fredo are in the business and the third al pacino michael has just come back from the war a decorated hero the occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter talia shire connie to gianni rizzi carlo russo all the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifullymarlon brando who apparently decided that what george c scott did was so good in refusing the oscar for patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus indian princess to tell why despite that bit of cheek brando certainly deserved an oscar for his performance don vito is compelling as criminal and family man brando might have been lucky though in that al pacino who really is the main character in all three godfather films was nominated in the supporting actor categoryin fact pacino was nominated with james caan and robert duvall who plays tom heggen the family lawyerconsigliere and brandos adopted son that three way tie guaranteed the oscar for joel grey in cabaret with eddie albert being nominated for the heartbreak kid as the fifth theyre all great but pacino should have been in the best actor categorysinger al martino plays johnny fontaine who if you didnt know that this was frank sinatra again youd have to have been living on another planet in fact the identification is made complete by the fact that martino sings i have but one heart at the corleone wedding which was an early sinatra hit sinatra was not happy with the godfather and broke off relations with martino and with richard conte who plays don barzini one of the other mafia dons part of the underside of the sinatra legend is worked into the plot as wellthe images and dialog of the godfather have entered into our popular culture the horses head in john marleys bed the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an offer he cant refuse or lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the filmthe key scene i think in the godfather is between the retired brando and pacino who has taken over the crime family brando isnt happy about the road he took for success but its what was available to him he hoped that pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life it wasnt to be but maybe the next generation i think its beautifully playedin fact its all beautifully played",2014-04-01,NA

"pulp fiction (1994)","the masterpiece without a message","kylopod","one of the early scenes in pulp fiction features two hitmen discussing what a big mac is called in other countries their dialogue is witty and entertaining and its also disarming because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal if you didnt know better you might assume these were regular guys having chitchat on their way to work other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims their talk has no relevance to anything in the film or to anything else for that matter yet without such scenes pulp fiction wouldnt be pulp fiction i get the sense that tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully texturedits no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase reading far more into the story than tarantino probably intended the film is so intricately structured with so many astonishing details many of which you wont pick up on the first viewing that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation but there is no deeper explanation pulp fiction is as the title indicates purely an exercise in technique and style albeit a brilliant and layered one containing numerous references to other films it is like a great work of abstract art or art about art it has all the characteristics we associate with great movies fine writing firstrate acting unforgettable characters and one of the most wellconstructed narratives ive ever seen in a film but to what end the selfcontained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itselfthe movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that its essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie but something always goes wrong some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures tarantinos originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead even if they move the story away from conventional plot developmentsperhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions indeed the whole film seems to consist of digressions no character ever says anything in a simple straightforward manner jules could have simply told yolanda be cool and no ones going to get hurt which is just the type of line youd find in a generic runofthemill action flick instead he goes off on a tangent about what fonzie is like tarantino savors every word of his characters finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references but the lines arent just witty they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior think of mias statement to vincent thats when you know youve found somebody special when you can just shut the f up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silencewhat is the movies purpose exactly im not sure but it does deal a lot with the theme of power marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time the whole point of the big date sequence which happens to be my favorite section of the film is the power that marsellus has over his men without even being present this power is what gets vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away the power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film its liberal use of the nword in this film the word isnt just used as an epithet to describe blacks jules for instance at one point applies the term to vincent it has more to do with power than with race the powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters most of these gangsters are not racist in practice indeed they are intermingled racially and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many lawabiding citizens in our society they resort to racial epithets because its a patter that establishes their separateness from the noncriminal worldtheres a nice moral progression to the stories we presume that vincent hesitates to sleep with mia out of fear rather than loyalty later butchs act of heroism could be motivated by honor but were never sure the film ends however with jules making a clear moral choice thus the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for selfpreservationstill its hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories none of the stories are really about anything they certainly are not about hitmen pontificating about burgers nor is the film really a satire or a farce although it contains elements of both at times it feels like a tale that didnt need to be told but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind or of any other kind",2014-07-24,NA

"the matrix (1999)","one of the best action sci fi action movies of all time","u","writing a review of the matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore i want to do the film justice by writing a good review to tell the truth the first time i saw the film i was enamored by the effects i remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films i had ever seen in my life also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much it wasnt until some time later and after having seen the film a few times more that i started to think about the film i recognized the christian elements quite quickly but it wasnt until i wrote an actual page essay on the film that i tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more i wont say that i have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with themacting wise the film works excellently i wont say that there arent any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless keanu reeves plays the main character neo or thomas a anderson and while he is not the perfect actor i think he does a pretty good job in the matrix and the sequels he doesnt have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and i must say that overall his body language is very good very clear and well defined laurence fishbourne plays neos mentor morpheus and he does an excellent job of it his lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting carrieanne moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit joe pantoliano a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character cypher to life i cant say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and i certainly dont want to spoil it for anyone gloria foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job the best acting is provided by hugo weaving however in his portrayal of agent smith it is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character agent smith gains some human traits like anger sense of dread hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor mostly in the sequels two thumbs way up to weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all timeeffects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the oscar for best effects and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the best film category ahead of even star wars the reason that i think the matrix deserves the oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in the matrix are more innovative than the ones in star wars just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and youll probably agree the effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in blade runner and this works brilliantly the film looks beautiful at all times and today  years later my god has it already been  years the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands very well donethe reason that i think the matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing i catch something i didnt see the previous time i watched it without spoiling the film i think i can mention a few of the more obvious elements obviously the film draws on the messiah myth as neo is a clear reference to jesus with the analogy of his name neo  one as in the one but also hidden in his other name thomas a anderson the first part of his last name anderson comes from the greek andros meaning man and combine this with the second part of his last name son and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination son of man which was a title jesus came up with about himself also the first time we meet neo a man calls him and i quote youre my saviour man my own personal jesus christ it doesnt get any more obvious than that aside from the christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from budhism gnosticism gnosis  knowledge but is also inspired by plato and his analogy of the cave and jean baudrillards essay simulacra and simulations explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them i will not comment on them furtherto all the people who doubt the profound nature of the matrix i can only give one advice free your mind and watch the film again you wont regret it if i had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either the matrix obviously i dont expect people to agree but if they do thats great or the lord of the rings the return of the king and i recommend it to all fans of scifi and people who like philosophy  on my top  of best films",2014-07-26,NA

"the matrix (1999)","a masterpiece","kirpianuscus","the matrix may not be one of the very greatest examples of its genre like  metropolis blade runner back to the future star wars original trilogy alien and aliens but that it is revolutionary in how its visuals and use of sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be deniedit is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between neo and trinity being the matrixs sole weak spot this ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executedparticularly striking about the matrix is its production values simply put the film looks amazing in its audacious production design dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultracool and imaginative to exist super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography so much more than a film with groundbreaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundariesuse of sound was also striking and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used andy and larry wachowski direct adeptly while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and wellexplored themes mysticism philosophy and even lewis carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly doneaction is superbly shot and edited and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy kung fu has rarely been more vertigoinducing despite how this sounds this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the storys atmosphere on filmkeanu reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then carrie anne moss is strong even better are an imposingly charismatic laurence fishburne also in one of his best roles an amusing joe pantoliano and a deliciously wicked hugo weavingsumming up not one of the best of the genre but a milestone nonetheless and a great one followed by two sequels both nowhere near in the same ballpark  bethany cox",2005-12-02,NA

"the matrix (1999)","one of the best action sci fi action movies of all time","u","writing a review of the matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore i want to do the film justice by writing a good review to tell the truth the first time i saw the film i was enamored by the effects i remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films i had ever seen in my life also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much it wasnt until some time later and after having seen the film a few times more that i started to think about the film i recognized the christian elements quite quickly but it wasnt until i wrote an actual page essay on the film that i tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more i wont say that i have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with themacting wise the film works excellently i wont say that there arent any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless keanu reeves plays the main character neo or thomas a anderson and while he is not the perfect actor i think he does a pretty good job in the matrix and the sequels he doesnt have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and i must say that overall his body language is very good very clear and well defined laurence fishbourne plays neos mentor morpheus and he does an excellent job of it his lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting carrieanne moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit joe pantoliano a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character cypher to life i cant say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and i certainly dont want to spoil it for anyone gloria foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job the best acting is provided by hugo weaving however in his portrayal of agent smith it is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character agent smith gains some human traits like anger sense of dread hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor mostly in the sequels two thumbs way up to weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all timeeffects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the oscar for best effects and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the best film category ahead of even star wars the reason that i think the matrix deserves the oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in the matrix are more innovative than the ones in star wars just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and youll probably agree the effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in blade runner and this works brilliantly the film looks beautiful at all times and today  years later my god has it already been  years the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands very well donethe reason that i think the matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing i catch something i didnt see the previous time i watched it without spoiling the film i think i can mention a few of the more obvious elements obviously the film draws on the messiah myth as neo is a clear reference to jesus with the analogy of his name neo  one as in the one but also hidden in his other name thomas a anderson the first part of his last name anderson comes from the greek andros meaning man and combine this with the second part of his last name son and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination son of man which was a title jesus came up with about himself also the first time we meet neo a man calls him and i quote youre my saviour man my own personal jesus christ it doesnt get any more obvious than that aside from the christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from budhism gnosticism gnosis  knowledge but is also inspired by plato and his analogy of the cave and jean baudrillards essay simulacra and simulations explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them i will not comment on them furtherto all the people who doubt the profound nature of the matrix i can only give one advice free your mind and watch the film again you wont regret it if i had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either the matrix obviously i dont expect people to agree

"the matrix (1999)","one of the best action sci fi action movies of all time","u","writing a review of the matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore i want to do the film justice by writing a good review to tell the truth the first time i saw the film i was enamored by the effects i remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films i had ever seen in my life also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much it wasnt until some time later and after having seen the film a few times more that i started to think about the film i recognized the christian elements quite quickly but it wasnt until i wrote an actual page essay on the film that i tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more i wont say that i have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with themacting wise the film works excellently i wont say that there arent any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless keanu reeves plays the main character neo or thomas a anderson and while he is not the perfect actor i think he does a pretty good job in the matrix and the sequels he doesnt have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and i must say that overall his body language is very good very clear and well defined laurence fishbourne plays neos mentor morpheus and he does an excellent job of it his lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting carrieanne moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit joe pantoliano a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character cypher to life i cant say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and i certainly dont want to spoil it for anyone gloria foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job the best acting is provided by hugo weaving however in his portrayal of agent smith it is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character agent smith gains some human traits like anger sense of dread hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor mostly in the sequels two thumbs way up to weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all timeeffects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the oscar for best effects and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the best film category ahead of even star wars the reason that i think the matrix deserves the oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in the matrix are more innovative than the ones in star wars just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and youll probably agree the effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in blade runner and this works brilliantly the film looks beautiful at all times and today  years later my god has it already been  years the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands very well donethe reason that i think the matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing i catch something i didnt see the previous time i watched it without spoiling the film i think i can mention a few of the more obvious elements obviously the film draws on the messiah myth as neo is a clear reference to jesus with the analogy of his name neo  one as in the one but also hidden in his other name thomas a anderson the first part of his last name anderson comes from the greek andros meaning man and combine this with the second part of his last name son and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination son of man which was a title jesus came up with about himself also the first time we meet neo a man calls him and i quote youre my saviour man my own personal jesus christ it doesnt get any more obvious than that aside from the christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from budhism gnosticism gnosis  knowledge but is also inspired by plato and his analogy of the cave and jean baudrillards essay simulacra and simulations explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them i will not comment on them furtherto all the people who doubt the profound nature of the matrix i can only give one
