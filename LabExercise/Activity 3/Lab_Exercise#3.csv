"1","Mr. & Mrs. Smith","Supermanfan-13","13 March 2024","8/10","You can tell Mr. & Mrs. Smith was created by Donald Glover because it has the same feel as Atlanta. They shouldn't have called this Mr. & Mrs. Smith though. I think that's why some people left negative reviews because it doesn't resemble the movie at all. I think the people who didn't like it would've liked it more if they called it something else because they went into it expecting the story to be along the same lines of the movie. It's not. It doesn't make it bad though. Both Donald Glover and Maya Erksine were fantastic in this. They have such natural chemistry. This show has plenty of drama, action, comedy, etc to keep you entertained.","Will keep you entertained"
"2","Mr. & Mrs. Smith","DiCaprioFan1","2 March 2024","8/10","I had an absolute blast watching Mr. & Mrs. Smith. I just binged all 8 episodes over the weekend and it was such a fun show it flew by. This is both a good spy thriller and a good rom-com. Donald Glover and Maya Erksine are both terrific as the leads and every episode has guest stars from other well known actors. It had Alexander Skarsgard, Eiza Gonzalez, Paul Dano, John Turturro, Ron Perlman, Ursula Corbero, Sarah Paulson, Wagner Moura, Parker Posey, among others. Each episode was a different adventure and they were all fun to watch. Glover and Erksine star as John and Jane Smith. Two loners who are put together to work as spies for a mysterious organization.","Better Than Expected"
"3","Mr. & Mrs. Smith","gehete-40949","3 February 2024","8/10","This series has nothing but the premise in common with 2005s mr and mrs smith. First of all the main lead while charming in his own right is no brad pitt, similarly the female lead no angelina jolie. The premise of the first movie was shallow, it was just 2 overly attractive film stars who were never seen together in a movie fawning over each other and displaying their sexiness, with some bad plot in the background. This movie actually explores the plot, two pretend married agents going on missions and step by step getting intimate. It is a blurry line they are traversing between the professional strictly lethal business and the attraction. It is complex,a very messy unconventional hands on movie i would very much like to compare to beef. You never know where the plot is going or how the relationship will develop. Its messiness does contribute to it losing focus, it is set up as a spy thriller but the dialogue is very much atlanta like, way more casual intertwined than any spy movie ive ever watched. This is however to its detriment sometimes because whilst the story, the progression are enjoyable due to the complexity it creates, you have a hard time buying either of the characters as stone cold killers they are supposed to be.Still the dialogue is simply superb, the chemistry is there, the story is a thrill. You just need to remove the bradjelina glasses and enjoy the ride.","people are misunderstanding this series"
"4","Mr. & Mrs. Smith","FeastMode","7 February 2024","4/10","I see a lot of discussion surrounding how alike or different this is from the movie. Even though I love the movie, I went into this without any expectations on what it should or shouldn't be. But even with an open mind, I just found myself not fully enjoying this series. I reluctantly continued through to the end.It has plenty of good. Both leads give great performances. I enjoyed the dialogue, especially the heated debates. There are a few powerful moments. And the action is serviceable (but scarce).It's hard to understand why I couldn't get into it more. But I think one problem is that, episode to episode, there are major shifts in their relationship and the story in general. We don't see how or why it happens. It's all offscreen and it's fairly jarring. On two different occasions, I double checked which episode I started to make sure I didn't skip one.For that and other unknown reasons, I always felt at an arm's length from this story. And the series in general. I think many will like it, but it's not something I'd personally recommend.(1 viewing, 2/6/2024)","I wish I liked it more"
"5","Mr. & Mrs. Smith","Laight","23 February 2024","2/10","There's so much wrong with this show it's hard to know where to begin. The worst part might be that the two leads are actually excellent actors, but you wouldn't know it if you judged them solely on this show, because they are forced to play possibly the two dullest human beings who have ever existed. The entire first episode, with a small exception for one moment of inane drama, is like watching paint dry, but without the excitement. It's almost as if the two are having a boring contest: who can be the dullest person. They both win. And they continue to win throughout this extremely poorly written, poorly plotted show. How Donald Glover, one of the most talented young actors, got roped into this is the only mystery this show presents.","Disappointing. Boring. Flat."
"6","Mr. & Mrs. Smith","ZinQ","6 February 2024","3/10","Wow, the first episode was awesome, I thought, this is going to be great! Silly me, the subsequent episodes were just farcical, plain silly, or just plain boring. Episode 5 should have been good, but so much time was wasted on their rapid and unreal, relationship. Their unbelievable relationship does not ring true at all. The casting itself has its problems. I'm actually typing this as it's playing on Prime, because I just don't care what is happening on the screen. All in all, an opportunity lost. This could have been so much better. I seriously doubt it will see a second season. I'm not sure I'll bother with any more, it just does not move along fast enough, and is way too flippant.","Groan!"
"7","Mr. & Mrs. Smith","jtbhbyzqfy","4 February 2024","8/10","Hihi...if you love the film then you'll hate this...it's sharper, wittier, sweeter, more intelligent, more interesting.The film is popcorn-fun with some genuine laughs but does nothing of real interest. The TV series is entirely different and not at all what I expected; it shares a name and the premise is reversed, but connected - that's it. This is very different, and more importantly it's a better version of that different thing.It's not a comedy, it's a drama about relationships with some violence, fashion, and luxury homes thrown in. It's incredibly sweet in places and sad in others. The therapy episode has the lowest rating but is crucial to the rest, especially when compared to the final scenes.","Not what I expected - so so so much better!"
"8","Mr. & Mrs. Smith","realdeancool","3 February 2024","8/10","I felt driven to provide a review after seeing the dumpster fire growing here. People seem to be expecting to see the Donald Glover they remember from Community, or some endless, action-packed rollercoaster that simply repeats the movie formula for a dozen hours.Let this series be what it is, a spy dramedy, halfway between drama and comedy, just like a relationship, which is key to this show.The opening sequence seems like a nod to the original, telling us that the Pitt/Jolie Smiths were taken out by other Smiths, after running for some unstated period of time.Then we can learn about a new Mr and Mrs Smith, from recruitment to retirement, and watch their relationship grow, through the lens of international espionage. It's a fun concept that is well executed, if you can just let go of the fact that it isn't the same as the movie.","This isn't the movie, get over it."
"9","Mr. & Mrs. Smith","therealhman","5 February 2024","8/10","Great acting by Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith. Excellent story, fast paced, and very believable.Donald Glover, John Smith, and Maya Erskine, Jane Smith were made for these roles. Maya steals the show with her comedic timing and great delivery of her lines. The action is fast paced. The supporting cast is excellent.It's quite a trick to follow Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, the original Smiths but Donald Glover and Maya Erskine pulled it off.Don't know why the low 6.5 rating. There are many 7+ rated shows that are not nearly as original and well written as this one.If you are looking for action, good acting, and a fast paced fun story this the movie to watch. Sure hope there is a season two.","Great show. Binge worthy. Don't believe the low rating"
"10","Mr. & Mrs. Smith","cbrueggemeyer","2 February 2024","6/10","I fell victim to the marketing ploys of this show and was excited for this show to be released, watching most of the series the day it was released.It is well made and had a good production value. Well shot and for the most part well acted. But I find the subject matter to be dull and the writing to be a bit lazy.This is a spy show that is missing all of the quintessential ""spy things"" found in the genre. First off, the characters are basically Craigslist Kirkland-brand spies. They are not very good at their jobs and they are following the orders of a chat-GTP style entity. Also, the series is episodic, so they are in a new location doing a new task every episode. This is okay, but 90% of the episode is spent examining their relationship, while 10% is spent doing a few spy things.All of the realism in this show is spent on relationship building. It's like a committee sat down and wrote a standard rom com using fights, quirks, and highlights from all of their previous relationships and packages them into a show. Needing a hook, they threw in a few lazily-written spy scenes to match it watchable.I'm being a bit harsh here. The series is somewhat enjoyable and the relationship scenes are pretty well executed and well thought out. But if you are looking for an espionage/spy show with any sort of realism, this isn't it. This is a show about the fake marriage between two people that just happen to be spies.","Somewhat Interesting But Ultimately Falls Flat"

Well shot and for the most part well acted. But I find the subject matter to be dull and the writing to be a bit lazy.This is a spy show that is missing all of the quintessential ""spy things"" found in the genre. First off, the characters are basically Craigslist Kirkland-brand spies. They are not very good at their jobs and they are following the orders of a chat-GTP style entity. Also, the series is episodic, so they are in a new location doing a new task every episode. This is okay, but 90% of the episode is spent examining their relationship, while 10% is spent doing a few spy things.All of the realism in this show is spent on relationship building. It's like a committee sat down and wrote a standard rom com using fights, quirks, and highlights from all of their previous relationships and packages them into a show. Needing a hook, they threw in a few lazily-written spy scenes to match it watchable.I'm being a bit harsh here. The series is somewhat enjoyable and the relationship scenes are pretty well executed and well thought out. But if you are looking for an espionage/spy show with any sort of realism, this isn't it. This is a show about the fake marriage between two people that just happen to be spies.","Somewhat Interesting But Ultimately Falls Flat"

This movie actually explores the plot, two pretend married agents going on missions and step by step getting intimate. It is a blurry line they are traversing between the professional strictly lethal business and the attraction. It is complex,a very messy unconventional hands on movie i would very much like to compare to beef. You never know where the plot is going or how the relationship will develop.

I seriously doubt it will see a second season. I'm not sure I'll bother with any more, it just does not move along fast enough, and is way too flippant.","Groan!"

The TV series is entirely different and not at all what I expected; it shares a name and the premise is reversed, but connected - that's it. This is very different, and more importantly it's a better version of that different thing.It's not a comedy, it's a drama about relationships with some violence, fashion, and luxury homes thrown in. It's incredibly sweet in places and sad in others. The therapy episode has the lowest rating but is crucial to the rest, especially when compared to the final scenes.","Not what I expected - so so so much better!"
"68","Mr. & Mrs. Smith","realdeancool","3 February 2024","8/10","I felt driven to provide a review after seeing the dumpster fire growing here. People seem to be expecting to see the Donald Glover they remember from Community, or some endless, action-packed rollercoaster that simply repeats the movie formula for a dozen hours.Let this series be what it is, a spy dramedy, halfway between drama and comedy, just like a relationship, which is key to this show.The opening sequence seems like a nod to the original, telling us that the Pitt/Jolie Smiths were taken out by other Smiths, after running for some unstated period of time.Then we can learn about a new Mr and Mrs Smith, from recruitment to retirement, and watch their relationship grow, through the lens of international espionage. It's a fun concept that is well executed, if you can just let go of the fact that it isn't the same as the movie.","This isn't the movie, get over it."
"69","Mr. & Mrs. Smith","therealhman","5 February 2024","8/10","Great acting by Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith. Excellent story, fast paced, and very believable.Donald Glover, John Smith, and Maya Erskine, Jane Smith were made for these roles. Maya steals the show with her comedic timing and great delivery of her lines. The action is fast paced. The supporting cast is excellent.It's quite a trick to follow Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, the original Smiths but Donald Glover and Maya Erskine pulled it off.Don't know why the low 6.5 rating. There are many 7+ rated shows that are not nearly as original and well written as this one.If you are looking for action, good acting, and a fast paced fun story this the movie to watch. Sure hope there is a season two.","Great show. Binge worthy. Don't believe the low rating"
"70","Mr. & Mrs. Smith","cbrueggemeyer","2 February 2024","6/10","I fell victim to the marketing ploys of this show and was excited for this show to be released, watching most of the series the day it was released.It is well made and had a good production value. Well shot and for the most part well acted. But I find the subject matter to be dull and the writing to be a bit lazy.This is a spy show that is missing all of the quintessential ""spy things"" found in the genre. First off, the characters are basically Craigslist Kirkland-brand spies. They are not very good at their jobs and they are following the orders of a chat-GTP style entity. Also, the series is episodic, so they are in a new location doing a new task every episode. This is okay, but 90% of the episode is spent examining their relationship, while 10% is spent doing a few spy things.All of the realism in this show is spent on relationship building. It's like a committee sat down and wrote a standard rom com using fights, quirks, and highlights from all of their previous relationships and packages them into a show. Needing a hook, they threw in a few lazily-written spy scenes to match it watchable.I'm being a bit harsh here. The series is somewhat enjoyable and the relationship scenes are pretty well executed and well thought out. But if you are looking for an espionage/spy show with any sort of realism, this isn't it. This is a show about the fake marriage between two people that just happen to be spies.","Somewhat Interesting But Ultimately Falls Flat"
