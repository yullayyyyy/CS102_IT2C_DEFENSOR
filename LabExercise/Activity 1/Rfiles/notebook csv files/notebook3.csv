"1","Notebook","Leitz A4 Hard Covered Notebook, Squared, 90 gsm Ivory Paper, Solid Range, Black, 80 Sheets","Dr E Bliss","The item is:  Leitz A4 Hard Covered Notebook, Squared, 90 gsm Ivory Paper, Solid Range, Black, 80 Sheets  item code 4664I feel compelled to review this item because my reading of some others’ reviews leads me to think that they were reviewing some other item.I needed a hard-backed A4 squared-ruled journal log-book; not too thick, and also robust enough to use daily without it becoming tatty.  This item, Leitz A4, 4664, bound pages – easily meets my need and is presentable; it looks good. For the price that I paid (£6.15) I was completely satisfied; it is easily worth the money.I like especially the grid-squared spacing (5 mm) and the paper quality (90 gsm) suits my fountain pen ink - so that there is no feathering. There is negligible soak-through of my fountain ink, so that my writing on one side of the paper is not noticeable on the other side.I would by it again and also recommend to others.  Excellent quality.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 September 2023","4.5 out of 5 stars"

"4","Notebook","Leitz A4 Hard Covered Notebook, Squared, 90 gsm Ivory Paper, Solid Range, Black, 80 Sheets","Neil","I picked this up because I get through a lot of A4 notepads in my day job and am always looking for good quality ones.This is a hardback cover notebook with an attractive laminate purple cover with a circular design.  The notepad also comes in white, orange, lime green, pink, blue and ice blue.  There are 80 pages (or 160 sides) and the pages are ruled but note that the ruled lines are framed within each page and do not run from edge to edge.  There's also a header box with space for a title and date, which does make it easier to organise notes but also cuts down on the amount of space you have to write in.The paper quality is good - I use rollerballs generally and there wasn't any leakage through the paper and the ivory white colour means that most ink colours show up on it.My only real criticism is that it's quite expensive for what it is - there are other providers out there doing decent quality pads for a quarter of what this costs.  As such, I can't say that I would rush to buy one on that basis but your needs may be different.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
