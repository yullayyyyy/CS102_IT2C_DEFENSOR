It writes and sketches well with a comfy grip. The built-in eraser is handy for fixing mistakes.The positives: Writes smoothly, easy to use, comfy grip, and the eraser works for light fixes.The negatives: Eraser wears down fast, and the pencil feels a bit light. Erasing a lot might leave faint marks.Overall, it's a good pencil, but the eraser could be sturdier.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"9","Pencil","STAEDTLER 121-2 BK5D Noris School Graphite Pencils - HB Degree (Pack of 5), Black","doris","These pencils are made with ""Upcycled Wood"" (sawdust and offcuts, in effect). I find this means they are less rigid when compared to the traditioal cedar pencils, and though they sharpen smoothly, they do not write as dark. Plus, they lose the classic cedar wood smell. Not a seller fault, purely the product Staedtler have chosen to make.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
