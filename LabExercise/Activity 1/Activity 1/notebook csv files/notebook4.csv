"1","Notebook","My Notes A4 Card Cover Wirebound Notebook, Ruled with Margin and Perforated, 200 Page, 1 Notebook Black","R Coleman","About a year ago I bought some Oxford Campus notebooks and found them excellent. I really like how my fountain pen looks on the pages, there's no bleeding unlike with other notebooks (e.g., Pukka Pads). Recently the Oxford Campus line was changed to include ""support"" for Oxford's Scribzee app, which I didn't want — there are ugly blue markers in the corners of all the pages of the new notebooks.Happily, this notebook is very similar to the old Oxford Campus ones; that is to say, it doesn't support Scribzee and has clean pages for you to do as you like with. One of the photos shows my old Campus notebook (left) next to this one (right). The paper is almost exactly the same between them (the old one looks a little grey as it's been in my bag for several months).Overall, I'm very happy. This is a quality notebook at a good price without any gimmicks like the Scribzee app.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 June 2018","4.6 out of 5 stars"

One cool thing about this book is that it has the function to use an app and take a photo! (could you tell I was being sarcastic?)However even if it is something as simple as taking a photo the app allows for easy and clean filing of work so that you can keep your notes on you anywhere you may go. (considering you bring your phone around with you)Overall good product, wish that it was a bit bigger but no biggie!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 December 2016","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"4","Notebook","My Notes A4 Card Cover Wirebound Notebook, Ruled with Margin and Perforated, 200 Page, 1 Notebook Black","R Coleman","Purchased this as it was one of the only lines of oxford notepads left without the god awful ‘sribbleze’ marks in all 4 corners of every page.Overall I’m impressed. The paper does what it says and works very well with fountain pen ink, not allowing any feathering etc. The ink didn’t get through to the other side of the page either. The pages look and feel excellent quality and are a bright white.Unfortunately it is a soft back notebook and after just week of use I’m starting to see wear. I don’t mind the back getting worn down but this in turn allows the pages inside to crease etc. I would also rather have grey lines than blue.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 January 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"7","Notebook","My Notes A4 Card Cover Wirebound Notebook, Ruled with Margin and Perforated, 200 Page, 1 Notebook Black","Greg","The paper quality is good, and is a delight to write on with any pen. The only downfall to this product is the pad itself, it fell apart and now i just have a pile of paper that is annoying to carry around school and needs to be taken care of as its easy to crush. The main lining of the spiral outside unwound one night and all the paper just fell apart.
