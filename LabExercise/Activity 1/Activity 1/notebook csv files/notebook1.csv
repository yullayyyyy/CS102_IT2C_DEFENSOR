The spiral binding is a gem, allowing me to spread out my ideas across both pages without any hassle. The paper quality is top-notch, handling my pencil and ink sketches with ease. It's robust enough to endure my frequent erasing and redrawing, a crucial factor for any artist. The environmental aspect of using 100% recycled paper adds a touch of responsibility to my art. This sketchbook has become an indispensable part of my daily sketching routine.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"5","Notebook","Blue Acorn A3 Spiral Bound Portrait Sketchbook - 42x29.7cm - 70 Pages (150gsm) - Multi Purpose Cartridge Paper – Ideal for Light Washes of Paint, Inks, Pencils, Sketching and Brush Pens","Ernestina","This sketch book is well made and uses high quality materials and paper which is thick enough not to have any ink or paint bleeding through to the other side which means you can use both sides of the paper without any issues. This has been perfect for my young daughter who loves painting and drawing and lasts longer due to being able to use both sides of the paper. The sketch book is quite sturdy with nice solid covers and a spiral binding. Highly recommended. At the time of review the price is £14.65 which I feel is a little on the pricey side despite the high quality.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I always think describing it as 70 pages is a bit misleading. Personally I only ever draw on one side so counting both sides does not seem right but hey ho. The pages come spiral bound between ridged covers the back cover is particularly sturdy which is good as it will protect your drawings even if you are carrying them around. The paper is A3 and is a good quality 150 gsm smooth cartridge type paper. At 150gsm it is not the thickest but it is as described and is certainly adequate for sketching. I usually use a thicker paper but found this worked pretty well. All in all this is a very good quality pad and at a very reasonable price.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The covers are made of a stiff cardboard and the book itself is spiral bound and just feels good quality.The pages itself are thick and have the perfect texture to draw on whether it is pencil or even watercolours.

That said, the thick (150gms) paper feels premium and versatile enough to cope with various media. For me, pencil and charcoal takes fine with it.Finally, the cover is genuinely protective, for anyone who (unlike me) takes their art outside!A decent buy.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
