"2","Notebook","Amazon Basics Classic Black Casebound Notebook with Elastic Closure, Blank / Plain, 240 pages, Large 13.4 x 1.7 x 21 cm","Amazon Customer","This is exactly what I was looking for. It is just a notebook that gets the job done. I have no real issues with it. It’s great for casual note-taking or just some doodling. The quality is fair for the price. If you are looking to get the best notebook, this isn’t for you. But if you want a notebook that works as a simple, everyday notebook, this would be a great choice. The price is not necessarily cheap, but it is generally quite an inexpensive notebook overall.Cool features/mentions:- I like the built-in bookmarker and the elastic that keeps the notebook fully shut. It is very compact. The size is small enough to carry around, and large enough to do all your note-taking, drawing or doodling.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"3","Notebook","Amazon Basics Classic Black Casebound Notebook with Elastic Closure, Blank / Plain, 240 pages, Large 13.4 x 1.7 x 21 cm","Jim","Since bullet journaling has taken off, it becomes harder to find good notebooks at a good price point - so stumbling across this notebook was a stroke of luck.The page thickness is best suited to a ballpoint pen to prevent ghosting on the back of the page, but can stand up to gel pens and fineliners with minimal ghosting. I haven't attempted to use any kind of paint, but I would recommend putting a protective sheet under the page you're painting on and anticipate that it may wrinkle.The covers are strong and would take a good amount of force to bend or buckle. The elastic is taut but pliable, exactly what you need when you use a notebook frequently, the ribbon well attached and a good length for use. The pocket at the back is a comfortable size to fit in loose pieces of paper (and your hand when trying to retrieve small fiddly cut-offs you may have tossed in there).It will take me a long time to fill this notebook, but I will be looking to purchase another when that time comes.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 January 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"5","Notebook","Amazon Basics Classic Black Casebound Notebook with Elastic Closure, Blank / Plain, 240 pages, Large 13.4 x 1.7 x 21 cm","Eve","Product works as advertised, it's a blank notebook with a well built exterior that can handle being put in a bag.It has a holder for all sorts of pages in the front underneath what I'd assume to be a stronger paper material flap, very useful for holding scrap notes, a built in bookmark to keep track of where you were, a good choice of paper that feels amazing to write on alongside an elastic band in order to stop the notebook accidentally opening while being transported.Overall, very satisfied with this, look forward to be using this as a daily driver for my notes, reminders and doodles.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"8","Notebook","Amazon Basics Classic Black Casebound Notebook with Elastic Closure, Blank / Plain, 240 pages, Large 13.4 x 1.7 x 21 cm","Zach Z.","This notebook's paper is pleasant write on with a standard fineliner whose ink instantly dries, or broad-size ballpoint, or broad rollerball, even pencil such as 2B. Any pencil harder may feel scratchy. And certainly not fountain pen because its ink would leak through; I've tried it and the ink leaked through to opposite side. Let's be fair: The notebook is 'budget', but for the above writing pens it's okay.Out of personal preference I chose unlined paper and love that the pages are sewn-in like the more expensive notebooks. Glued-in at the back is a handy off-white envelope-type pocket with black sides to keep stamps and whatnot. I'm impressed the notebook contains a generous 240 pages. This plain notebook is my 5th.The notebook's paper is not the highest quality, but is great for note making or quick sketching. It also costs a lot less than many rivals. This makes for fantastic value for money! The notebook is available in plain, ruled or squared.It would make a nice present for someone who likes notebooks.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
